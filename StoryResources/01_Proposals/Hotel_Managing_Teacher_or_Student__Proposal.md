[?] Check Jacob be more adventurous

Jacob is not a very adventurous person. He doesn't much like to go out if he doesn't have to.

[?] Try something different on the computer.
[?] Try something different in the hotel.
[?] Try something different near the hotel.



[+] Try something different on the computer.
Jacob is a horny teenager, but he never dared look for porn online.

[?] Try to find porn online.

[+] Try to find porn online.
It's late and Jacob hopes no one will be up to catch him doing something naughty. He clicks on a tantalizing banner and just falls down the rabbit hole.

There are so many options for a guy to find porn online. He is not very daring, though, and doesn't go beyond some nudity. Titties are just great and he is shocked when he sees a naked pussy for the first time.

Jacob becomes extremely horny.

[?] Does he risk masturbating?

[+] Does he risk masturbating?
Jacob has had some wet dreams and he even masturbated a couple of times, thinking of hot girls, but he tried to kid himself that those were just accidents.

This time, though, he is just too horny and can't help but take out his cock and start jerking it.

He remembers the girls in the pictures he saw previously and wanks harder. He doesn't really know what he would do the girls if he had one of them in his arms. He thinks about kissing, then, about touching a cute, soft boob and that is enough to making explode.

A little embarrassed, he cleans himself and goes to sleep.

[-] Does he risk masturbating?
Jacob never actually dared masturbating. He had a couple of episodes, but he always tried to tell himself he just touched himself by accident. Even though the girls online looked incredibly hot, he decides to ignore what he saw and go to sleep.

The next morning, Jacob wakes up with a raging hardon and has a lot of trouble ignoring it as he goes about his routine.

Jacob is hornier and a little frustrated after this episode.



[+] Try something different in the hotel.

Jacob wakes up earlier. He is tossing around in the bed and decides to just get up.

He goes to the bathroom and finds that there is someone in the bathroom. Coming closer, he realizes it is Kelly, taking a shower.

[?] Spy on Kelly taking a shower?

[+] Spy on Kelly taking a shower?
Kelly is humming softly and doesn't notice Jacob cracking the door open and peeking at the naked girl.

She looks hot under the shower, her skin glistening, her long hair wet. The shape of her hips, her naked back, her long legs all combine to make her a very exciting sight.

Jacob becomes hornier and more daring.

[-] Spy on Kelly taking a shower?
Jacob is either too afraid or too respectful of Kelly to spy on her under the shower. He turns away, a little wistfully and keeps on with his morning routine.
