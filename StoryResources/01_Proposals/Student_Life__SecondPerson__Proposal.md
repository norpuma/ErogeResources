You live the college life.

You are unaware, but there is a woman who is trying to make femdom popular in town.

You may end up with a harem (hardest), you can end up with a girl you love (pretty hard), you can end up with a partial harem (a little hard), you can end up a slave (not hard), you can end up on the streets, with a soiled reputation and nowhere to go (bad ending).



-> Chances to be assertive also mean being "mean", "dickish", "evil"
-> Chances to be "nice" also mean being a "wimp".
