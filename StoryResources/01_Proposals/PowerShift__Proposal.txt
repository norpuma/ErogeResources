Based on "Couple's Mistress"

Lauren is a psychologist with a Femdom agenda. She is organizing a "Lifestyle Coach" group in town for women only.

You are a teacher at a local college. It is not a prestigious college and you do not have a prestigious position.

Dannie, your girlfriend, is very nice, smart and attractive. But she has some issues. She is has a lot of hangups regarding sex.
She and her mother were abandoned by her father when she was 7. She both has anger issues with her father leaving and has some serious abandonment issues that makes her want to be nice and accepted by everyone. She represses those.
She feels she owes her mother for raising her by herself and not getting a serious relationship or a good job. She is uncomfortable with being away from her mother for so long.
She can be very entitled. Her mother treated her like a princess and she often thinks she deserves more than she gets.
She is vain/proud of her smarts and of how nice she is.
Being a late bloomer, she is insecure about her appearance.

The game is about determining the balance of power.
