    It's been 10 years since the revelation that aliens exist on heart and have been influencing society for some time. Ten years of society break down, of government fragment, of the rule of law mostly disappearing. Aliens keep their own fiefdoms across the land and parcel out miraculous xenotech to whomever they deem worthy or at their convenience. They have inscrutable objectives and can take the appearance of ordinary humans.
    
    Hornton is trying to establish itself as a Reborn City. A new haven of civilization. There is not much to look at, right now, but some people are making an effort and the promise of opportunity has attracted some talented entrepreneurs and visionaries. Right now, though, it looks more like an old frontier town, where everyone is a little suspicious and a few people establish the rules and keep the law. As it is, Hornton is not a place for children and only those aged eighteen and above are allowed in town. The nature of the place also makes it very unusual for older people to join the town. Most of the population has ages between 18 and 45.
    
    Hornton is surrounded by under developed neighborhoods, barely providing services and amenities for the local population. Herville, several hours away to the South is the greatest hub nearby. There are miscreants everywhere and people are always afraid.
    
    You are one more of the otherworldly invaders, but you do not, yet, have a physical presence on the world. Becoming aware of Hornton, you decide to anchor yourself there. Where do you want to look at first?
    
    - Town Hall
    - Renaissance General Store
    - Colony Finishing School
    - Good Times Tavern
    - Dreams Hotel



    # Town Hall
    The Hornton town hall is a very simple affair. A small bureaucracy barely concerned with zoning and permits, trying to attract the right people and expand the town.
    
    Four people make most of the decisions there: John Smith, a former office manager, mostly concerned with procedures; Alvaro Vargas, an older man and former police chief, mostly concerned with security; Emily Clark, a small business owner (beauty parlor), mostly concerned with trade; and Gavin Pol, a grocer, mostly concerned with productivity. There are also Jamal Ewing, Lucy Dallas, Courtney Tennison and Anthony Levinson, all young aides, concerned with making things work and eying opportunities to grow in the bureaucracy. A small number of teens work at the town hall as interns.
    
    John Smith is very civic-minded and donated the xenotech power generator he gained in a service he provided for aliens, a service is unwilling to discuss. 
    
    The Town Hall houses a xenotech communications hub, with most of the content of the old internet and the capacity to produce handheld communication terminals, akin to "phones".
    
    The Town Hall houses a xenotech power generator, connected to all households and providing electricity.
    
    # Dreams Hotel
    A rundown place, pretty much in ruins, recently inherited by the Wood family. It has the potential of becoming a beacon of quality and luxury or, at the very least, a convenient place for visitors and new comers into Hornton.
    
    The Wood family has limited resources and the adults work at the Finishing School. They have numerous family members, however, some of them already well established in the currently small Hornton community, and they can leverage that into fixing the place.
    
    # Renaissance General Store
    The store currently provides everything the small Hornton community needs to buy, but for the mall to grow. Daren Crawford and his children work at the General Store. There is a plan for a Renaissance Mall in the land owned by the Crawford family, but it is currently little more than a distant dream. Specialized stores and services must come into town, however, for the community to flourish.
    
    # Colony Finishing School
    The pet project of John Smith and Gustav Claremont, the Finishing School is supposed to provide youths with the necessary skills to be productive members of society in the new world and to provide the schooling many youngsters missed during the turbulent last ten years. It is mandatory to attend Finishing School for every person below 21 years of age, all of which are not considered full-fledged citizens, but Teenagers.
    
    It currently only has Catarina Velasquez and Gustav Claremont working there. But they have resources to quickly grow as the Teenagers education is one of the few items that everyone at Town Hall agrees is a priority. Steve Wood and Sarah Wood are joining as teachers.
    
    # Good Times Tavern
    The only real entertainment at Hornton, Good Times is restaurant and drinking place manned by Joseph Lock, Amelia Green and their respective children. It has the potential to grow and will need to do it in the upcoming months as the Hornton community grows.












    # Stars Clinic
    The most important building in Hornton, the Stars Clinic houses the xenotech healing device that is currently the jewel of the community. Roberto Martinez, a biologist, and Patricia Wall, a citologist work at the clinic.
