    You are bright, not a genius, but very bright. And you got a couple of lucky breakthroughs when you were in college.
    
    You don't have much in terms of social skills. You are not exactly a shut in, but you mostly kept to yourself. In college, when it was time to experiment and flex your social muscles, for some time you relied on the {i}serum{/i} and, other than that, you mostly interacted with for a time was your harem. Now, you are out of college, trust into the real world and it appears you didn't learn how best to interact with people.
    
    You can focus, you can sit down and study for a big test, but not when you are horny. This is something you found out when you were in high school and you kind of got around that easily when you had your harem, but now, you probably could find some tricks to get around that, otherwise, the solution may not be as easy as it once was.
    
    A year ago you were a chemical engineering student, getting ready to graduate soon and looking for something to do over the summer. You had started college at a different school, but when your mom got a new job in this town, she brought your sister and you to live here with her. Transferring schools wasn't easy, but you knew you had to accompany your mom, the family simply didn't have the funds to sustain you living on your own. You only made one real friend in college and were feeling more than a little detached when you landed that summer job on campus as a lab assistant working with a two person team.
    
    The college wasn't really a prestigious one and most of the funding went into the trying to make the basketball team relevant again and redeeming the reputation of having become a modern Sodom and Gomorrah. That is probably why sororities and fraternities were banned and why they instituted the strict uniform policy. Your lab director, Nora, and her long time lab assistant Stephanie were investigating the properties of a new lab created molecule, though. It was an exciting opportunity, even though they hadn't gotten very far with it and weren't sure what they had found. One night, studying on your own, you got a breakthrough and discovered it could be used to deliver mind altering agents. You spent the summer creating doses of \"{i}serum{/i}\" in secret and testing it on some of the women around you.
    
    In time you built a harem, you were having crazy sex with Nora, Stephanie, your best - and only - friend, Alexia and even Lily, your sister, and Jennifer, your mom. Your experimentation with the inhibition removing {i}serum{/i} was fun and you had a great time until all hell broke lose. People started realizing the change of behavior of some of your test subjects and, worse of all, you discovered a nasty side effect in the formula, which led to memory loss. You ended up packing up your things in a hurry and fleeing to another country to let things cool off. You created decent excuses for the people you left behind, but most of it was swallowed in the memory gaps they got. Luckily, you discovered the effects were all temporary.
    
    While abroad, you did some more testing with the small cache of {i}serum{/i} you took with you. You can't use it as it is, but access to a good lab, supplies and more test subjects may help you get another breakthrough and figure out how to use it safely. As it is, you know that if you use the current version of the {i}serum{/i} no more than once a week, you can do it with no serious side effects, however, the effects are also very short-lived.
    
    Now, you are getting back to town, you got a job at a small pharmaceutical lab, mostly thanks to a glowing letter of recommendation and accompanying video you got Nora to record for you while she was still under your influence. You secured a position as a researcher with some autonomy and more clout than maybe you deserve, but you may be able to use this to your advantage.
    
    ====
    
    Today is your first day at ${company_name} and you just moved back in with your sister and mother. Relationships are a little strained, they don't seem to remember anything from that summer, but they have an inexplicable resentment towards you, seemingly stemming from some unconscious memories.
    You head for the front door, eager to get to your new job early and cause a good impression.
    mom "[mom.mc_title], are you leaving already?"
    [mom.possessive_title]'s voice comes from the kitchen, along with the smell of breakfast.
    mc.name "Yeah, I want to make sure I make it on time."
    mom "You haven't had any breakfast yet. You should eat, I'll drive you if you're running late."
    "The smell of cooked toast and frying eggs wins you over and you head to the kitchen."
    $ kitchen.show_background()
    $ mom.draw_person(emotion = "happy", position = "back_peek")
    "[mom.possessive_title] is at the stove and looks back at you when you come into the room."
    mom "The food's almost ready. Just take a seat and I'll make you a plate."
    mc.name "Thanks Mom, I didn't realize how hungry I was. Nerves, I guess."
    mom "Don't worry, I'm sure they'll love you."
    She turns back and focuses her attention on her cooking. A few minutes later she presents you with a plate. You could get used back to this. For an instant you remember her doting on you like this, but wearing only an apron and nothing else and giving you a blowjob under the table while you ate. Something flashes behind your mother's eyes, however, and you eat as quickly as you can, your eyes avoiding hers.
    $ mom.draw_person(emotion = "happy")
    mom "Here you go sweetheart. You look very sharp in your suit, by the way. My little boy is all grown up."
    You eat quickly, keeping a sharp eye on the time. When you're done you stand up and move to the front door again.
    $ clear_scene()
    Your mother drives you to ${company_name} to ensure you can get there on time. You feel somewhat self conscious getting driven to work by your mom, but she seems to have lightened up. When she straightens your tie and brushes some lint off of your shoulder before you leave the car, you feel like things will get back to normal in only a short time.
    $ downtown.show_background()
    mom "Oh, I should have ironed this for you."
    mc.name "It's fine, Mom. Really."
    mc.name "It's fine, Mom. Really."
    mom "I know, I know, I'll stop fussing. Good luck sweety."
    You hop off the car and take a look at the small building nudged between two warehouses. It feels like the owner resist some kind of corporate buyout or city rezoning. It will not be easy coming here every day.
    You walk in, past an empty reception area, before you are too far in, someone rushes out to meet you. Its your new boss.

    initial_director "Hello, my name is ${initial_director.names.standard} and I am the lab director here. Are you [mc.name]? We have been expecting you!"
    The woman shakes your hand and smiles warmly at you. She gestures for you to follow and starts walking.
    initial_director "Let me give you a quick tour of our facilities and introduce you to everyone."
    initial_director "This is our reception. We don't have many clients walking in, of late, and we were forced to let our receptionist go a few weeks back. No the phones ring directly at my desk."
    She offers you a somewhat self-conscious smile and you start wondering how far the company is from simply shutting down.
    initial_director "Up here we have my office."
    She points to you and lets you take the lead.
    
    The two of you walk into an upstairs area with a few office rooms, all of them clearly empty but one. You realize this company was, once, bigger and vibrant, but it is now only a ghost of itself.
    initial_director "I'm the only one working from here, right now. I like to keep an open door policy, so you can come in any time you want. I encourage our people to be open and talk to one another. I trust we will get to know one another pretty soon."
    initial_director "Now, lets go to the basement."
    
    In the underground floor, you find a lot of open space, a lot of outdated lab equipment and a small area, closer to the stairs, where a woman is checking working equipment and inputing some data into a computer with a slightly cracked screen.
    initial_director "Hey, ${initial_production.names.standard}, say hi to [mc.name]. He is going to be our new researcher."
    The woman looks up from her screen a sketches a tired smile.
    initial_production "Hello. Pleased to meet you. I'm ${initial_production.names.standard}."
    While she is shaking your hand, she looks up at the director and asks her:
    initial_production "Is he replacing Jerry? Nice! It was about time. I really need someone to..."
    initial_director "Hey, ${initial_production.names.standard}, lets not overwhelm [mc.name] with that right now, shall we? You will get to it in time."
    initial_production "Sure thing, ${initial_director.names.standard}."
    She agrees with a rueful grin. Then, she looks at you, sharply.
    initial_production "[mc.name] come see me as soon as you are settle in. We will probably be depending a lot from one another's work."
    initial_director "Okay, okay. Let's get going."
    initial_director "Upstairs..."
    She points you to the ground floor.
    
    initial_director "In this area, we have the non-technicals. Actually, right now, we only have ${initial_supply.names.standard}, who handles supplies. We outsourced deliveries ages ago, but we used to have a marketing area. We closed it last year, but with you here, maybe we will get some new ideas and may need people to market it out again."
    initial_director "Anyway, here is ${initial_supply.names.standard}."
    ${initial_director.names.standard} opens the door to an office area with a few empty tables and a young woman buried behind several stacks of paper of different colors. She stands up suddenly, adjusting her hair and trying to look less frazzled.
    initial_supply "Hi! I'm ${initial_supply.names.standard}!"
    She offers you a hand to shake, but keeps a serious expression. You get a feeling she is trying to act very proper and professional.
    You shake her hand and introduce yourself. She doesn't smile, but her posture relaxes a bit, as if she was fearing a different action from you.
    initial_director "Let's get going. See you later ${initial_supply.names.standard}."
    The young goes back to her work. After closing the door, the director comes closer to you and speaks in a low voice.
    initial_director "That's ${initial_supply.names.first} ${initial_supply.names.last}, daughter of ${initial_owner.names.first} ${initial_owner.names.last} the owner. She could have my job, you know? But she wanted to work through the ranks. She started here as an intern at the lab. She would still be there if we hadn't needed to lay so many people off and move her to supplies."
    You nod before being directed down the hall to another area of the ground floor.
    
    initial_director "And, lastly, here we are. The lab!"
    initial_director "This is your domain. We expect great things from you and you are granted a lot of autonomy to get to it. We understand that research requires some level of creativity and inspiration, so you are not too constrained in terms of working hours, but we DO expect results. I left some of our basic goals on your computer and here are the basic information you will need to use the network and the facilities."
    initial_director "I will get out of your hair now. Good luck and welcome to ${company_name}!"
    With that, she steps out and leaves you alone in the lab.
    
    ===
    
    Here are the 3 goals you are expected to meet, in no particular order, before the end of the 4th week:
    - Revise the basic design.
    - Decrease the number of side effects in the company's flagship product.
    - Propose a line of research.
    
    -- Small budget
    -- Contract testing and quality assurance
    -- Can hire an assistant (who can do most of the job)
    -- Placing a lot of trust in you
    -- Nora is ${initial_supply.names.standard} best teacher at school and her recommendation had a big impact in the owner's decision to hire.

    You had a summer of wild adventures and you achieved some amazing effects with the serum you produced in Nora's lab. But, then, you were too ambitious and tried to use the serum on ??? You found out there were risks to using people as lab rats, especially some powerful and influential people. You had to flee and you spent two years away. As you communicated with your family and friends, you discovered the effects of the serum were only temporary and that the memory of people affected by it became hazy. You had used the serum mostly in private settings and that lead people to make up their own stories to some of their unbelievable and fractured memories.
    
    Now you are coming back. You have a chance to do things right. To make yourself into more of a power than the apprentice you were previously. You have a chance to perfect the formula, breaking it down into its components and studying their effects individually. You need access to raw materials and high grade equipment and Nora's lab just doesn't exist anymore. So, you get a job as a janitor at a small college with an unusually great chemistry lab and you get a small place for yourself. You want to visit your mother and sister again, but you are not sure how they will react. Besides, it is better not to go back to the places you used to visit until you are sure it is safe.
