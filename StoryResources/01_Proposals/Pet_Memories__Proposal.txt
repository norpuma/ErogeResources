::Remember your taking
You were a free man before the taking. Living a blessed life without being aware of it. You had your hardships and, at the time, they seemed so serious. But, now, in retrospect, you had it easy.

Things may have changed later, but at the time:
- You liked girls. (and you hid it)
- You liked boys. (and you hid it)
- You liked both. (and you hid it)

Maybe:
- You were a naive young man. A virgin at 18, worried about high school and how to lose your V-card.
- You were a young man, fresh into college, concerned with your grades to avoid losing your scholarship and how to get a first job. Maybe you had a girlfriend.
- You were a young professional of your chosen field. You felt like you were headed for success. Maybe you had a girlfriend or even a fiancée.
- You got fired and found that your job options just weren't so great. You had to look for unusual opportunities.
- You were a not-so-young man. You were secure in your job, but felt your life was getting a little stale. You had a wife, or maybe you were divorced. It is possible you had a kid or two.
- You made a mistake.

- You were an inexperienced teenage girl.  A virgin at 18, worried about high school and how to lose your V-card.

- You made a mistake.

You remember how you were taken:
- There was a black bag over your head and a needle in your arm.
- You were conned into becoming a pet. It seemed like a regular job, maybe a little exotic, but it was so much more than that.
- You were seduced and tricked. It was meant to be temporary, but it became your life.
- You were blackmailed into it. You didn't really understand what you were getting into, but it didn't seem so bad, then, as it turned out to be. Not as bad as the alternative.
