# Synopsis
The game revolves around sexual stories around a big cast of characters always limited to a single town: Hornton.

Stories shouldn't take too long to become sexual. Also, powerplay (domination and submission) are very common themes.

# Format
There is an enormous cast of characters, a huge town (for computer games) with lots of locations and dozens of stories to tell.

Write the stories in short-story format. Then see how they fit as games.

Use "Notes" and "Storylines" to keep track of everything.

Create "Default" storyline and, later, allow Protagonist to intervene.

There are multiple potential Alphas and multiple potential Protagonists.

It is a different world. Similar to ours, but with some big differences.

There are aliens in the world and civilization has had to adapt.



# Horton
The world was invaded by aliens twenty years ago. They didn't come in spaceships, they just started taking over some people and ended up in control of the entire planet. They can replace the mind of anyone or even the mind of animals, but they rarely do so anymore. Aliens often put themselves in positions of power either as individual autochrats or by forming their own communities. Outside of Alien dominated towns and cities, lawlessness often dominates as society has broken down in most places.

Aliens require children of less than 18 to be segregated from most people that are not parents into Education Districts. Many towns have become somewhat self sufficient as people are often afraid to travel around. Lawlessness dominates the roads and any place outside of Alien dominance.

Newly sprawls across the land. Buildings of the old world turned into abandoned husks except of a few areas around the heart of the acient city. Downtown was walled off and turned into one of the Education Districts after the alien occupation and the dregs of humanity relegated to surrounding areas. Two aliens have proeminent dominions around the heart of Newly: Tillery and Sechton. They have their own closed off spaces where humans can only go with invitations. Where Tillery often appears to the conquered, in the form of a middle aged woman with regal bearing presiding over baroque cerimonies in an enormous mansion converted into a temple, Sechton never appears outside their white-marble palace and their appearance is a matter of rumor and speculation.

Hornton is the name the remaining humans call the area they keep active south of the Newly Education District. They keep a human council with their own rules and try to keep an independent and self-suficient little settlement. The aliens Tillery and Sechton dole out the amazing technologies aliens are reputed to have and that has provided the Hornton inhabitatns with an almost supernatural power source and a fabrication technology that can be finicky at times, but can generate almost anything the old human industries could produce.

Beyond the city limits lie only bandits, raiders and the Lateray farms. Honrton inhabitants treat the farmers as backwater bumpkins and people from the farms consider those of Hornton uptight snobs. Commerce between the two places is fruitful and essential, however.

The closest civilized settlement beyond Lateray is Fillen, to the Southwest.

Some technological marvels arrive at Hornton through trade or contraband. The town council demands the right to examine and forbid any alien artifact from entering Hornton, but this rule is often broken.

People try to live a life not too different from before the arrival of the Aliens, going to school, buying stuff, browsing the internet and ignoring the fact that anyone could reveal themself to be an alien.

It will go through a slaver-society period, then a femdom, then a black superiority periods until it is controlled by machines.
