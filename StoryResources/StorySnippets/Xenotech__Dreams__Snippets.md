    The Invader creates a connection to a world they have never visited before. It exists in multiverse of possibilities and alternate histories, similar to other worlds previously visited, but, somehow unique.
    
    As they connect to the world, they have a chance to decide how they want to see themself in this adventure. They can select a name and they can select a pronoun. Everything else can be decided later.
    
# Snippet end
# Snippet start

    Connection is so weak at first that only a few things can be perceived. There are individuals, minds that can be perceived and connected to and there is a sense that those minds are all relatively close together. ${the_invader.names.standard} probably can only connect to the minds within a single town, at first.
    
# Snippet end
# Snippet start

    ${the_invader.names.standard} finds a mind and gets ${the_invader.pronouns.possessive} first impressions. ${the_invader.pronouns.subject.capitalized} sense a name "${target.names.standard}" and a vague notion of age... "${target_age_group_string}". ${target.names.standard} is asleep and ${target.pronouns.subject} feels a little aroused in ${target.pronouns.possessive} sleep. That's ${the_invader.names.standard_possessive} entry point. ${the_invader.pronouns.subject.capitalized} can sense that sex, desire, arousal and eroticism will be key elements for this invasion.
    
# Snippet end
# Snippet start

    There is little ${the_invader.names.standard} can do to affect this world, for now. As ${the_invader.pronouns.possessive} connection to this world strengthens, ${the_invader.pronouns.possessive} options and his influence will certainly increase. Right now, however, the best ${the_invader.pronouns.subject} can do is induce a general feeling into a sleeping subject's mind. The goal should be to increase the target's arousal - ${target.names.standard_possessive} arousal.
    
    After some time of pondering, time that to this world seemed like only the tiniest fraction of a second, ${the_invader.names.standard} came to a decision. With a pulse of otherworldly energy and will, ${target.names.standard} felt... desired. It was vague. It was weak. But it was enough to nudge ${target.pronouns.possessive} sleeping mind into forming a new dream...

# Snippet end
# Snippet start

    ${target.names.standard_possessive} arousal increases with this new direction ${target.pronouns.possessive} dreams are taking.

# Snippet end
# Snippet start

    ${target.names.standard_possessive} arousal reaches a point where ${target.pronouns.subject} starts unconsciously touching ${target.pronouns.reflexive} in ${target.pronouns.possessive} sleep.

# Snippet end
# Snippet start

    ${target.names.standard} wakes up very aroused and already touching ${target.pronouns.reflexive}. ${the_invader.names.standard_possessive} connection usually fades away when a target wakes up, but ${target.names.standard_possessive} is high enough that it sustains the connection until ${target.pronouns.subject} climaxes.
    
# Snippet end
# Snippet start

    As ${target.names.standard} starts touching ${target.pronouns.reflexive}, a feeling for discomfort starts tainting ${target.pronouns.possessive} current dream. ${target.pronouns.name} is not used to masturbating and feels reluctant to do so. Pushing ${target.pronouns.object} any further, right now, has a chance of making ${target.pronouns.object} wake up disturbed.

# Snippet start

    As new options become available to ${the_invader.names.standard} when influencing dreams, one seems more unusual than others. Adding a "monster" to one of the minds ${the_invader.names.standard} can connect to can be useful in the near future, when the Invader will become capable of forming a body. This may come to create xenophilia. If minds are not exposed to this before hand, they will probably only react with fear when exposed to ${the_invader.names.standard_possessive} body if it is not entirely human.

# Snippet end
# Snippet start

    ${the_invader.names.standard_possessive} connection becomes too weak to sustain. Time slips away and some time passes in the world before ${the_invader.pronouns.subject} is capable of connecting to it again with renewed energy reserves.

# Snippet end
# Snippet start

    As ${the_invader.names.standard} connects to ${target.names.standard_possessive} mind, ${the_invader.pronouns.subject} finds the familiar mind is already following the patterns ${the_invader.pronouns.subject} has been helping establish in the last few connections. As ${target.names.standard} unconsciously feels the connection being established, ${target.pronouns.subject} just started dreaming of one of the familiar scenarios, naturally incorporating feeling ${target_frequently_induced_sensation} into ${target.pronouns.possessive} dream and after only a short while, starting to masturbate. It turns out that ${the_invader.names.standard} has created, in ${target.names.standard}, a habit of masturbating when feeling the connection.

# Snippet end
# Snippet start

    As ${the_invader.names.standard} created a habit of masturbating in ${the_invasion.dream_influence.count_habitually_masturbating_minds} familiar sleeping minds, the next step of the invasion becomes possible. It is not much to harvest, but it is enough at this point. The familiar minds require no energy to detect and briefly connect to and as they are asleep, they don't present no resistance to being setup for syncing and draining. At each visit, ${the_invader.names.standard} can now obtain some of the resources ${the_invader.pronouns.subject} needs.

    The humans in this world have some simple mental patterns, it appears. When dreaming and already aroused, a couple of well chosen sensations will induce them to masturbate and the right feelings are felt in the right order, they will be strongly aroused when doing so. Even if not aroused, a few more feelings lead them to get into the mood and masturbate. Now, it can be interesting to find out what happens when a disagreeable feeling is induced at the height of arousal.

From time to time, ${target.pronouns.subject} stops, strikes a pose and feels the flashes of numerous photographers washing over ${target.pronouns.object}. ${target.pronouns.subject.capitalized} feels ${target.pronouns.reflexive} flush with the attention, but puts a bright smile in ${target.pronouns.possessive} dream and continues posing and walking down the infinite red carpet.

Then ${target.names.standard} feels the attention countless others around ${target.pronouns.object}. It is impossible to distinguish faces or much more than vague silhouettes, but from time to time ${target.names.standard} can focus and get a clear view of a smile or a pair of bright eyes, expressions that could signify so many feelings, but, right now, in this dream, those undoubtedly indicate desire, a hunger from the onlookers for ${target.names.standard}.

    ${target.names.standard} pictures ${target.names.reflexive} under a bright sun on a warm day looking over the waves and, then, taking a pleasant walk on the beach. It takes ${target.pronouns.object} to realize ${target.pronouns.subject} is wearing a ${target_sexy_swimwear} that accentuates the bets features of ${target.pronouns.possessive} body. As ${target.names.standard} walks along the shore, ${target.pronouns.subject} realizes the effect ${target.pronouns.subject} has on onlookers. There are so many eyes pointed in ${target.pronouns.object} direction, but they all convey the same thing, desire and envy. There is no judgment nor ridicule, just admiration and lust. ${target.pronouns.subject.capitalized} can hear people sighing and feel them holding their breath as ${target.pronouns.subject} passes.

It is about to happen and ${target.names.standard} can only think about that, wondering if it will be on the same cheek or the opposite one, if it will be as hard as the last one or, possibly, harder. How it will feel.

    ${target.names.standard} is dreaming of the Creature and it makes ${target.pronouns.object} feel fearful and anxious.

    The Creature is never seen, it prowls and snarls just beyond the edge of the light circle wherein ${target.names.standard} cowers. ${target.pronouns.subject.capitalized} wishes for a weapon, then for a way out, then for a place to hide, but there is nothing. ${target.pronouns.subject.capitalized} is just there, exposed under the rash light, defenseless, too scarred to enter the darkness to try to hide, certain that the Creature will catch ${target.pronouns.object} if ${target.pronouns.subject} ever dares try.

    The Creature never approaches, never revaels itself, but never rests and never lets ${target.names.standard} feel safe. There is a mysterious feeling that the Creature wants something, but it is impossible to figure out.
