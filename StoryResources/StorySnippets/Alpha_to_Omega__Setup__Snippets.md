## Living the Good Life

I wake up in my very comfortable bed, in a large and well appointed bedroom, beside my beautiful wife. I kiss her awake and go take a shower.

I enjoy the shower, observing that I am developing something of a gut. I should eat healthier and start going to the gym, but I still look okay, I guess. I fantasize about calling Ellie in for a blowjob, but it's just a fantasy.

I shave, put on some cologne and dress in a sharp, expensive suit.

Ellie is in the kitchen. We recently got Marisa to take care of the house, but Ellie often cooks. She prepared a nice breakfast and I eat while we talk. She looks fetching in her robe and I feel glad for how beautiful my wife is. She kisses me goodbye and tells me she will hit the gym as soon as I leave.

**

I drive to Cedar Publishing and park at a manager spot. I'm a junior sales manager, but I'm the son-in-law to the company's director - even if he has been absent for the last two years, that still carries som weight.

Tom is very polite to me at the door and I head to my table. Checking my e-mails, I find that there is a new manager to my team, Ms Alexa Bond. I check her profile online and feel gratified to know that she looks quite hot. We have a meeting scheduled for 15:00. I go to the printer and find Kelly there. She looks as hot as always and I indulge in a little flirtation. She says she will accept my dinner invitations anyone of those days and I actually believe her.

I'm introduced to Tiffany at the office. She is a new intern and looks quite scrumptuous herself. I flirt a little and she smiles at me. She seems impressed with my title as sales manager, even if I'm actually an assistant sales manager.

Ms Bond is hotter in person than she looked in her pictures. I'm can't stop looking at her legs. She does not seem to be too uptight and I feel confident I can impress her with my numbers in the next few weeks. Maybe we will have to stay late devising some new sales strategies one evening and things will get interesting.

Heading home, I pass in front of the gym. I feel a moment of guilt for not heading in, but it disappears quickly. Charlotte Dcker, our new neighbor, is outside when I pull in. I wave to her and she shows me her teeth. I have a feeling she doesn't like me too much, but she looks really hot, so I keep smiling at her.

**

Marisa is getting done for the day. She reports that everything should be in order at home and that she prepared a list of cleaning supplies we need. I tell her to just buy the stuff before she starts tomorrow and that I will reimburse her. She is happy enough with that and I get to appreciate her smile and her cleavage.

I go look for Ellie and find that she is in a videocall with Sam, her bratty young sister. I never much liked Sam, but I try not to Ellie notice. I go find a way to spend time and end up at the computer, watching a little porn. I always found Ellie beautiful, but I sometimes wish she had bigger tits.

I'm interrupted with my sexy browsing when Ellie knocks on the door to the office. I tell her I will be out in a few minutes and wait for my erection to subside before stepping out. Ellie and I have dinner together and, during dinner, she tells me, once again, that she feels lonely of late and that she wishes we could get a puppy. "I'm sorry, Ellie, but we can't. It's the same reason Penny couldn't get a puppy when we were younger, I'm allergic," besides, Penny was always a bitch to me and I was not sorry she couldn't have a pet, but I don't tell Ellie that.

"Baby," Ellie says, "I was talking to Marcela, today, the veterinarian at the petshop. She says there are breeds, now, that don't cause allergies."

"I don't know, El. I'm not sure we should risk that. They don't always work for everyone. Besides, I just don't think it's the right time."

Ellie looks hurt, but she understands. We finish the dinner in silence and soon go to the living room to watch a movie together. The movie isn't too bad, it has a hot main heroine and I start lightly stroking Ellie's breasts during the movie. She pushes my hand away a couple of times, but eventually she turns around and gives me a long, wet kiss, while I maul her breasts. She eventually takes off her shirt and pulls out my cock for a more vigorous rubbing.

"Oh, fuck, babe! Keep going! Keep going!" I encourage her, before pulling one of her breasts in my mouth and sucking. I blow my load in her hand in no time and I hear a little sigh escape her. I wonder if she is frustrated, but, as I look at her, she smiles at me. "I'm sorry, babe. But you are just so hot! And I had such a long day at the office!" I justify myself.

"It's okay, baby," she says with a sweet smile, before going wash her hands. "We will have more time for each other in the weekend."

She IS hot, I hope she considers my early climax as the compliment it is.

**

Ellie is studying in the living room when I get out of bed. Marisa left some light breakfast for me on the kitchen table when I get out of the shower and I barely talk to my wife before leaving. I kiss her before I go, though: "I love you!" I tell her with a brigh smile. "I love you too," she answers, before I step out of the house.

Tom greets me at the door to the company, but I barely register it as I find that young Tiffany is having some trouble with her card to enter the office. I help her and reassure her that the copmany systems are a little arcane. I tell her to come find me at any time if she is having difficulties and ask if she wants to have my number. She seems unsure, but agrees and I tell her to tell me her number so that I can call her and she will get my number on her device. She doesn't seem to happy at the ruse, but since I already have my phone in hand, ready to dial, she tells me her number and promises to save mine when I call her.

I corner Kelly in the printer room, again. She seems a little uncomfortable, but smiles at me, even if it is a somewhat weak smile. I neg her a little and she finally agrees to have dinner with me and I feel elated. Will I really have the chance to bed such a hot little piece of ass? I only had sex with three girls at the company before and none of them stayed around long enough for it to be a proper affair. It's not that I don't like Ellie, I certainly love her. But a man has to spread his seed around, you know?

Ms Bond calls me into her room and tells me I will have to work late. I'm surprised, but I wonder if my side-by-side strategy-meeting-turned-sexy-encounter fantasy of yesterday will come true just like that!

I let Kelly know that I will have to cancel our dinner plans for tonight and I call Ellie. My wife seems disappointed as the restaurant reservation had been a little hard to get and I am reminded that I had made dinner plans with her a couple of weeks ago. I tell her I have no choice as my bitch of a new boss is making me work late and she sighs in understanding. She says she will go to her sister's tonight, then, and I can't find how ot argue against it.

Work doesn't go as expected. It is, indeed, just Alexa and I at the office, but we are not discussing new strategies, we are reviewing my team's performance for the last two quarters and she is not too happy with our numbers. I do my best to hold my ground, but she seems really unhappy. I promise to keep an eye on my team and to make them step it up and we are done for the night. I guess I will have to have some harsh words with Kelly and Richard come Monday.

I find that there are three calls and half a dozen messages from Jeff when I get out of the office. I had agreed to go out for drinks with him, tonight. It seems I had actually triple-booked my evening. I send him a message telling him I had to cancel my plans due to my evil witch of a new boss and that we would have to reschedule. It was then that I realized Ellie wouldn't be home.

I guess that I deserve a reward for working late. I got extra pay for the late hour work and I need something to cheer me up. Since Ellie won't be home, I decid I can look for some company online. I feel too tired to go look for girls at a bar, so, as soon as I get home, I look at a discreet little site online for hookers and find Summer Blitz. She looked hot enough on her pictures online and doesn't charge too much. We exchange some messages and I find that she is available tonight and willing to negotiate her fee. I get both a 10% discount and no extra charge for anal. That's going to be hot!

Summer shows up at my door at the agreed upon time. I offer her a drink and after she has had a few minutes to settle in, I ask her to come suck my cock. I get offended when she asks for the money upfront and she relents. It's like I'm planning to cheat her out of her pay! She gives me a nice enough blowjob and I spank her ass a little. She doesn't mind. Before she makes me blow my load too early, I pull her away.

She rubs her head a little, when I pulled on her hair, but I tell her, very seriously, that she shouldn't try to make me blow too soon. I paid for anal and I intend to get what I paid for! She takes out some lube and throrougly covers my dick. I feel close to cumming again, with her handling of my cock, but I manage to hold back. I'm happy I don't have to do too much foreplay with her. She's a hooker, after all. I spit on her puckered little asshole and, then, I shove it into her anal passage. She cries out in surprise and a little pain, I guess, at taking a dick such as mine in her ass, but I think that if she chose to whore herself to earn money, she should be ready for a little rough sex. I pump into Summer's young, tight butt like a machine, holding onto a sexy little tit and at her throat for traction. She moans and pants at my invasion, driving me over the edge a little too soon.

"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! You nasty whore!" I cry in ecstasy, as I fill her with my load. "Take it! Take all my jizz! You deserve it! You deserve it all!"

I have always wanted to give a girl a facial, but it's just so hard to hold back long enough for that. Besides, I think it may be a little frustrating to climax with my hand jerking on my cock. Still, it would be so sexy to see a cute girl like Summer - or Ellie, for that matter - with her face covered with my juices!

I pull out of Summer slowly and I hear her panting slowing down and finishing with a little sigh. I guess she didn't have time to cum before I had to come out of her. She may be a little disappointed. Still, I'm the client, I guess it is my satisfaction that counts. She will have to be satisfied with the money I'm paying her.

"That was hot!" I tell Summer, all complimentary, after giving her a slap on the rump. "You were good too!"

She gets out of the bed slowly, leaving just a small trail of semen leaking out of her asshole. "Can I use your bathroom?" She asks.

"You can use the maid's," I tell her. "It's downstairs and to the right."

She sighs, once again, probably still recovering from the good fucking I gave her, and goes out.

I remember, then, that we have a maid now! I won't have to change the bedsheets myself!

When Summer comes back, I pay her and lead her to the door, attentive that she hasn't had any time to steal anything. "Thanks for the sex, babe! I hope we can see each other again!" I tell her as I kiss her at the door.

She pulls back, at first, but relents. "Likewise," she says after the kiss. She has a fake smile plastered on her features, but I know her wish is sincere enough. Even if she wasn't entirely satisfying by the sex, the money certainly is good enough.

I knock on Marisa's door. She works on dayweeks and Saturday mornings and only goes home Saturday after lunch, returning very early morning on Mondays.

It takes her a little to answer and I make a mental note. "Yes, Mister Rossio," she calls back, from her closed door, sounding a little hoarse.

"Please, change the bedsheets on my bed tomorrow, early in the morning, okay? I need you to do it before Ms Rossio comes home."

"Yes, sir."

Feeling pretty content, I take a shower and fall asleep in the living room, watching some silly movie.

**

I wake up with a call from Ellie. She wants me to join her for a run in the park. I politely decline. Getting before 10:00 on a Saturday morning sounds godawful. Going out for a run doubly so.

I ask Marisa to make me some breakfast and I'm happy to see that she changed the bedsheets as requested. I get a good eyefull of Marisa's legs as she cooks while I read a little on my phone. She looks great! I can't ogle her enough with Ellie around.

I go out to the mall to buy Ellie something nice. I also get myself something nice, after all, we both missed on the dinner at a fancy restaurant last night. In the year we have been together, I have developed a good sense of her taste and I feel pretty confident she will like the earrings I selected for her. I also call Jeff to share lunch at the mall. He agrees and we talk and laugh, remembering some good times together. He has been regaining his teenager physique lately. Jeff was always more athletic than I, but he was never too good of a student. He had planned of some career in sports, not much of a plan, if you ask me, and those plans were dashed when he got into an accident at nineteen. He gained a lot of weight, after that, but, for the last year, he has been focusing on getting back into shape. Without much of a career, I guess he has nothing better to do. He is getting buff again, but I wonder what for. He has no hope of becoming a professional athlete anymore.

As I get home, I find Charlotte on her lawn, again. She still looks pretty hot. And she looks like she dislikes me. I have no idea why.

My phone rings and it is Dannie. Fuck! I really should answer. I debate the issue for a moment, but decide to just bite the bullet.

"Hi, Dannie. What is it?"

Dannie is my ex-wife. I married really young and she was a few years older than I. I do have some fond memories of our first couple of years together, but it did quickly go downhill.

"Hello, Philip," she replies, frost tinging every word. "Could you meet up today?"

"Today?"

"Yes, right now if at all possible."

"I- What is this about, Dannie?"

"It's about Jessica."

Jessie is Dannie's daughter. I helped raise her and she still call me daddy, even though her mother and I have been apart for almost three years, now. I love her like a daughter and it just feels right to have her call me like that. I deeply regret that I don't see Jessie more often.

"What about Jessie?"

"She will be soon turning 18, Phil. You know how she feels about you. I was wondering if you will show up for her birthday party."

"Oh! Of course. Yeah. You can count on me."

"I had intended to meet with you and go over the planning for the party."

"Ah! Oh... Dannie, you know I suck at that kind of thing. I'm sure you will throw a lovely party, though!"

"What about the expenses, Phil? Would you help cover them?"

Ellie could be upset if I sent money to my ex-wife. On the other hand, she does like Jessie a lot. I ponder it for a few seconds before replying.

"Sure. I can help. Send me a rough estimate of the expenses and I will let you know how much I can help with."

"Uh... okay, Phil. You sure you don't want to help with anything else? Get a little more involved?"

"Nah, Dannie. I really think you are the best at that kind of stuff. I just trust you implicitly."

Dannie is still pretty hot, even though she has already gone over thirty. But she can be a nag at times and I really don't want to meet with her. Besides, everytime I hinted at a quick hookup or a flashback to our past, she shot me down cold.

**

Ellie is already home. She had lunch by herself and let Marisa go home. She is happy to see me and I kiss her passionately. She giggles at my passion and I spin her around, guiding her to the bedroom.

"What is this, baby?" She asks, smiling.

"I have a surprise for you," I whisper in her ear.

She turns around and smiles. I pull the giftbag from the bag I was carrying and she widens her eyes. "Oh, baby! A gift!"

"For you, my love!"

She pulls out the earrings and wonders at them. "They are perfect! I love you!"

"I love you too, babe!"

She kisses me! It's a nice kiss - a great kiss, actually! Ellie's mouth tastes great. Her lips are soft and her tongue quite skillfull. We share spit for a little, our hands roaming all over one another's bodies. I get a hand under her shirt and she breaks away from the kiss.

"I missed you last night," she says, her breathing heavy, as she takes out her clothes.

"And I missed you!" I tell her, sincerely. It felt great to fuck the little whore last night, but I would much have preferred having sex with Ellie. Even though she doesn't let me put it in her ass.

I get naked too and we twirl into the bed, locked into a new embrace. Her soft, warm skin just feels so good under my hands! Her firm little ass is perfect! Her tiny tits could be better, but having my mouth around them is just great.

Ellie keeps herself shaved down there and I enjoy sliding my hand there, exploring her folds, feeling her wetness under my fingers.

"Oh, baby..." she moans. "Could you- would you do... something for me?" I think Ellie really enjoys cunnillingus, but she is always so embarrassed to ask for it!

"Hm... babe... I don't feel too much like it. And, besides, it's not even your birthday..." She lets out a little moan as I slide a finger inside of her and I press my advantage. "And, besides, don't you want to feel hot, throbbing cock inside of you?"

"Oh, yes, Philip! I want you! I want you all inside of me!" She archs her back and her knees spread as she becomes invitingly open.

I get on top of my sweet wife and carefully place myself at Ellies entrance.

"Just... just go slow, alright?" Ellie... takes long to get wet. It's a condition, she looked it up online. So, she likes when we do some foreplay and she needs me to slide in slowly. That's part of the reason I like to shove it all in at once with whores like Summer.

Thinking of Summer and her tight little ass makes me extra hard and it is especially difficult to be patient. But I do my best.

"It's gonna be great, today, babe!" I promise Ellie, as I look into her eyes and try to hold back as I move only a little inside of her. "I'm going to fuck your brains out!"

"Oh, Phil..." She moans. I'm not sure how much is excitement and how much is annoyance. Ellie never felt too comfortable with dirty talk in bed. But I know that, deep down, she loves it. "Slow! Slow, please!" She begs.

"But, babe, I need you so much!" I say, as I press a little harder. Moving my hips back and forth, getting almost halfway in. "Don't you need me?"

"Yes," she says, as she winces. "I do. Come inside of me. I need you. But... not too harsh, please!"

I feel her trying to relax, spreading her legs further, closing her eyes and controlling her breathing. She is ready, I know. So, I push all the way in with a grunt. She moans and winces, but she is wet. She is wet, and warm and oh so very tight!

"Fuck, babe! Yeah! I love you!" I tell her, as I start moving faster and slamming myself against her pussy. "Oh, fuck!"

She just feels so good! I know she hasn't come close to climaxing yet, but her tightness and her warmth are doing their trick on me. I lay down fully on top of her and just move my hips back and forth, closing my eyes and trying to focus. Focus on holding back. I know I need to last longer. I need to last longer for Ellie.

"Hmm, yes... oh, yes!" She moans in pleasure, wrapping her arms around me. I feel the warmth and softness of her skin, her little breasts pressing against my chest.

The smell of her is just so good! So unique! I know it goes beyond the soap she uses. Beyond soap, deodorant, moisturizer or body spray. There is something that is just her, uniquely her, that I can never get enough of.

Young, and tight and delicious. She is too much. "Oh, fuck! I'm gonna cum!" I announce.

"Don't cum yet, baby!" She pleads, with a cry.

She tries to hold my movements and, for a moment, I try to comply. But, then, I realize I'm too close anyway and if I hold back it won't be a full orgasm. I increase the pace, fucking harder and faster, hoping to bring her over in time with me. Her breathing accelerates, she is getting more excited, I know it. I feel her pussy start pulsing around my cock and, then, it is just too much. It's impossible to hold back.

"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! You are so fucking hot!" I cry in pleasure as I climax inside my delicious new wife.

She bucks her hips in countertime. She wiggles side to side and lifts her hip off the bed, trying to find just the right stimulus to bring her over. Then, after a few moments, my dick slides out of her. She tries to pull it back in with a hand, but it's too late. I'm too soft and I have shrunk after the orgasm. She starts breathing slower and relaxes her body, under me.

I roll to the side and smile at her. "That- that was fantastic, babe! You bucking like that, it just felt so good. So urgent!"

She still has her eyes closed and is recovering. It takes her a few seconds to open her eyes and look at me with a tired smile.

"It- it was... it was great!" She says.

"Did you cum?" I ask, diligently. She has no need to ask me, the evidence is clear and abundant and leaking out of her pussy as we speak.

"I did, yes," she answers, before lying back down and closing her eyes with an arm over her face.

"Ah, great! Because, there, at the end, I thought that, maybe-"

"I was- I was chasing a second climax. You know woman can be multi-orgasmic, right?"

"Yes, yes, of course."

"How many times did you cum?" I ask her, feeling proud of myself.

"Uh, two. I came twice," she answers, before turning back my way and kissing me on the mouth.

It is, once again, a good- a great kiss. I like it. She fondles my balls and pull a little on my dick as we kiss. After a moment, I pull back, tired.

"There is just no way I will get back up today, babe," I tell her. "You know men are not like that..."

"Yeah, I know, honey. I just wanted to have some fun and enjoy your little dick and balls," she says with a sweet, but tired, smile.

"Your hands felt great, babe. Just- just don't call my dick little, okay?"

"Of course, baby!" She says, seeming hurt and regretful.

**

I wake up when it's getting dark. I find Ellie showered and good looking, reading in the living room. I give her a kiss and go for a shower myself.

We enjoy some time together, in silence, as she reads and I play a little on the phone.

It just feels so good to be side-by-side with her. I know she loves our time together.

We order some food and she tells me about her sister. Later she shows me some dresses and some jewels from a catalog. I try to remember some of those for future gifts before we go to bed, to fall asleep watching TV.

**

We have a lazy Sunday morning. We wake up late and enjoy the bed. Ellie says she is happy and proud that I changed the bedsheets while she was away. I feel good about myself.

She reads and I end up giving her a little foot massage. She enjoys it and I think it is turning her on. When I feel she is feeling happy and relaxed, I start kissing her thighs. Every kiss is a little closer to her crotch and I can feel her getting excited, her breath quickening. I look up and she is flushed, her eyes closed, biting a lower lip. I kiss her navel, I kiss higher and higher and she sighs. I kiss her breaths and I get to her mouth.

She kisses me back and it feels great. I kiss her neck and she caresses my chest. Then, I get to what I'm really planning, I straddle her and push my crotch against her face. She looks up at me, a little confused and I give her a knowing look.

"Please, babe! I- Well, you just know how much I love you and how much you could make me happy!"

There is an unspoken agreement between Ellie and I. Whenever I give her a gift, a big gift, I mean, I earn myself a blowjob. We were so good together, yesterday, after the earrings, that I didn't want to play my card right away. But Ellie certainly knew it was coming. I wouldn't just waste an opportunity like that.

She looks up at me again and, finally, nods. I can barely hear her sigh as I get off of her and start frantically pulling down my pants, my dick already getting hard at the thought. Ellie doesn't like giving blowjobs too much, but I just love them. I get, maybe, six an year... and an extra one on my birthday, and one on christmas, I think. Sometimes on the new year. And, today, I'm getting one!

"Let me look at your sweet little breasts, babe!" I ask, as she gets down on the bed, close to my crotch. She bares her breast, a look of long sufferenace on her face. Well, too bad. I know she likes it when I compliment her breasts, even though they are so small. And it's my time. I don't complain when she asks for oral on her birthday. Well, I do, but just a little, and I still do it anyway. So, tough luck.

Ellie plays with my cock and balls a little and I do my best not to tell her to take me in, already. Her hands actually do feel nice. She breaths on my cock and that makes me shiver in anticipation. My wife gives my pecker a few tiny kisses. I can't help myself, then, but I touch her head. Ellie simply hates it when I try to guide her movements when she is giving me oral, she hates that I pull on her head or anything. She lifts her head and gives me a warning look, I can only look apologetic. She seems to accept it, as her next action is to slowly wrap her lips around the head of my cock.

"Oh, fuck!" I exclaim, feeling very, very good.

My wife doesn't give the best blowjobs. I have certainly had better, but what she does is to keep a lot of eye contact and to show me how much what she is doing is just for me. It's terribly exciting.

She bobs up and down on my dick, her tongue swirling around. She sucks on it until she takes it out of her mouth with a pop. I can already feel myself leaking a little precum. She wipes her mouth and looks up at me, very serious.

"You warn me before you come, alright?" She says, gently tugging on my dick to keep me hard as she pauses. "You will warn me, won't you?"

Ellie absolutely loathes the taste of cum. I can't blame her. The problem is just that she is too hot. She is hot and whenever I warn her, she finishes me off with a handjob, which just doesn't feel as good as when I explose in her mouth.

I'm about to cum. I should warn her. But it feels so good. But should warn her. But it just fee- "I'm cumming!" I announce, a little too late to do anyone any good. Ellie is already pulling back from my cock a sour expression on her face. She rushes to the bathroom and I can hear her already brushing her teeth as the last jet of semen erupts out.

I let out a sigh of contentment. Guilty contentment, I guess. I do feel guilty for failing to warn Ellie soon enough.

My wife doesn't come back to bed. I go find her an hour later, after a quick post-coital nap.

Ellie spends most of the day still a little mad at me. But I cuddle her, I kiss her, I massage her back and she relents. We spend the evening cudled on the couch, watching something on the tv.

**

_That was the last time, I think. The last time I felt my life was truly perfect._
