::Adria - Flirt Steps
You receive $adria.name with a joke, which makes her smile and puts her at ease.

<<set _protagonistPreferredName = $adria.relationships[$protagonist].preferredAddress>> /* This will be either Mr Foster or Jake. */\ 
"Oh, _protagonistPreferredName, you are too much!"
---
You ask $adria.name about the weather in $otherTown.name. She seems surprised at first. Then, she remembers her comment the other day and laughs with you.
---
You make another joke, during the study session and as the both of you laugh, you touch her arm. She doesn't pull away and you see it as a good sign.
---
You receive $adria.name with a brief hug. The gesture seems to surprise her, but she doesn't pull away.
---
"Ciao, bella!" You say in a fake italian accent, before pulling $adria.name for a kiss on the cheek. She laughs and let you do it.
