There are some classic eroge (erotic games) storylines that we may want to emulate.

For this resources directory, they are organized by a male protagonist's age group (teenager, young adult, adult, mature) and by settings (home/neighborhood, school setting, office setting and hotel). Storylines, here, are mostly concerned with power play, so the male protagonist will be either a dominant character (an Alpha or a Jerk) or a submissive character (an Omega or a Wimp).

Character Archetypes will also be an important part in defining storylines.

Alpha and Omega files are organized in such a way that a single protagonist could live several adventures. They will have a Setup which creates a situtation that allows the character to live the different storylines and an Introduction that may help setup the tone and present the Setup in a narrative manner.

In scenes, all non-protagonist characters will be one of the following: ally, tormentor, victim, charmer, charm target.
