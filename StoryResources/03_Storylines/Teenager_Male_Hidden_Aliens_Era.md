    On his first week at school, Steve fails to make a good impression. Cal approaches him to ask what sports he plays and goes away disappointed that Steve not only doesn't play sports but doesn't know anything about local teams. He also inadvertently upsets Terrie, a hot and popular cruel girl at school by failing to recognize her and leaving her sit unoccupied when she arrives late in class. At lunch, Steve sits down at a table with two isolated people, a male and a female teenagers - Stella and Leonard - and he makes awkward conversation. In the afternoon, Steve pisses off a male teacher (Gus Williams, actually also the principal) by asking too many questions.


    He eventually gets distracted by hot female teacher, Mara Norris, during class. He eventually gets reprimanded by strict female teacher during class for ogling girls. He gets reprimanded by teacher for engineering opportunities to ogle girls (dropping pens to look under skirts, dropping females pens to get them to bend over, spilling water on female shirts to look at their bras or breasts through transparency).
