# Synopsis
This presents some basic statistics for sandbox games.

This may also help design characters from interesting archetypes or offering interesting professions and occupations.

This assumes the game happens in Honton, a town outside a bigger city dominated by three main alien influences at some point and falling into total debauchery at the end of the possible story cycle.
