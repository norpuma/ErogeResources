# Synopsis
This presents some interesting locations for an "open world" or "sandbox-style" erotic game.

The locations are all from Hornton, a small town outside a big city. The town is overtaken by aliens at some point and has to accept some harsh rules.
This assumes the game happens in Honton, a town outside a bigger city dominated by three main alien influences at some point and falling into total debauchery at the end of the possible story cycle.

Some locations exist mainly to provide interesting locations for sexy stories. A few locations exist just out of interest of making a more complete/believable setting.

This may also help design characters from interesting archetypes or offering interesting professions and occupations.

# Hornton Short Descriptions by Period
## Period: Pre-Aliens
- Hornton is a small, mostly residential, coastal and old mining town near the big city of Jarrin. It is close to the town of Herville. There are farms nearby. The sister-city of Polona attracts an unusual number of former Horton residents, as does the sister-city of Ozuel in spite of being in another country. The local grade school burned down recently with kids being taken to Jarin by bus since and, historically, teenagers frequent the high school in Herville. The Finishing School program was recently instituted.
## Period: Hidden-Aliens
- [Same as the Pre-Aliens description]
## Period: Open Aliens
- Hornton is little more than a memory in a world thrown into chaos by the Revelation.
## Period: Open aliens, Sexuality Suppressed
- Hornton is the seat of a revival project to create a Free City with same name as the pre-Revelation located at the same place. It is flanked by nearby Free Cities of Bicity and Aranel. Herville forms a small community nearby.
## Period: Sexuality Enhanced, Pre-slavery
## Period: Sexuality Enhanced, Hidden slavery
- Hornton is a quickly growing coastl Free City close to the territories of Bicity and Aranel.
## Period: Open slavery
## Period: Gomorrah
