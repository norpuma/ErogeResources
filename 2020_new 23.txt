You were in the basement, cleaning up some clutter as you had promised. The stuff had been there for ages and you were certain you wouldn't be able to do it in just one afternoon. That's when you tried to move a shelf and found that it was too old and not well secured. It came crashing down and even took a piece of the wall away with it. That's when you noticed the book.

Big, encased in black leather with red symbols on it, the book looked foreboding. It made you curious, though, and you tried to pull it out. It finally came away and, with it, there was a desiccated hand. With a cry of surprised you scrambled back. You decided to get out of the basement and found that when the shelf came out, it locked the door.

You pulled and pushed, you jiggled the handle, but it was all to no avail. There was no phone reception down there either and there was no one else home. You sat down and looked at the clock. You would be alone at home for, at least, the next four hours. And you had too little battery to wile the time away on the phone. After a few minutes, you cave in and decided to take a look at the book.

Incredibly enough the book suggested that it was a way to master the mind, the reader's and others'. It had a lot of lessons, but it all boiled down to learning some symbols. It was written in an obscure fashion and using unusual terms. It was not much fun, but you had nothing better to do.

There were very numerous symbols and the easiest were the ones for:
- 
- 
- 
- 

When you heard some sound upstairs you were shocked to realize four hours had flown by. You rush up the stairs and bang on the door. Soon enough, someone opens the door.

Who is it?

- You wife
- Your teenage daughter
- Your young adult daughter
- Your professional partner
- Your boss
- Your employee

How is your relationship?
- Good
- Difficult

You see the following symbol: 
What does it mean?
- A
- B
- C
- D
- Cheat
- Ignore it and give up on this silliness of magic (let someone else do magic).
