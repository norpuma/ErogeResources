# Definitions
Attitudes describe a set of behaviors.
Many characters have set behaviors and they can be described by how they act.
Attitudes, here, only speak of actions, not of intentions. See Personalities for intentions.

Some Attitudes will have actions preceeded by "NOT". Taking such an action is contrary to the attitude. Doing that action will make others see them less as the described attitude.
