# Attitudes and personalities:
    ### Subs/Wimps (incapable of wielding power; lacking confidence and easily manipulated or subject of having their spirits crushed)
    ### Cravens (do not fight for power, but wield it if offered to them; lacking confidence and easily manipulated, will, nonetheless, try to seize opportunity if exposed to real power and use it to crush others)
    ### Claws (full of ambition and a desire for power and greatness but without the means. Will reach out to Powers and Thrones or cowtow to Teases/Struts to get what they want or to be near greatness, hoping to get some crumbles)
    ### Dreamers (full of confidence, but unwilling to use it to their own gain and amusement; when offered real power, would refused it on principle (or out of arrogance))
    ### Teases/Struts (full of confidence in their attractiveness and sexuality, uses those for their own gains and amusement, may provoke a protagonist, but not as confrontational, planning to get admirers but not to use their skills for influence; should seem unattainable to most)
    ### Doms/Alphas (with a strong personality, willing to confront others, planning to get followers and/or a harem and use their skills to leverage power/influence)

## There are Elixir formulas to:
### Create a strong and almost instantaneous Pavlovian conditioning with a positive or negative connotation. This is the only permanent effect.
### Make a given area of the body (pinched just after taking the formula, to stimulate nerve endings) a trigger for instant pleasure (not associated to that area).
### Make a given area of the body (pinched just after taking the formula, to stimulate nerve endings) a trigger for instant pain (not associated to that area).
### Make a given area of the body (pinched just after taking the formula, to stimulate nerve endings) a trigger for instant nausea (not associated to that area).
### Temporarily increase horniness.
### Temporarily increase credulity, making the person more likely to believe in anything told to them.
### Temporarily decrease willfulness, making the person more docile and more likely to obey.


# The Old Master comes to TOWN to look for Dead Alchemist's trail.
# The Old Master acquires a copy of Dead Alchemist's grimoire and uses the Elixir to keep his daughter "studious" and "respectful". There are no annotations about the Method and Old Master does not use the formula to reinforce conditioning and make it permanent.
# The Witch sends her niece, Witch's Apprentice Babe, to distract the Old Master. She uses pheromones to influence him out of his sanctum, before the wards cancel all active magic.
# The Old Master meets his second apprentice - Mage Apprentice - a catalyst of Fate magic that brought several strands together to TOWN (including MC Professor and Accidental Magic Thief)
# After the Old Master gets two apprentices, the Witch feels confident that she can come into town.
# The Witch comes to TOWN following Old Master.
# The Witch, as she is coming to TOWN, gets help from Short Poolboy when she really needs it, and gifts him with the big dick - body magic.
# The Witch also acquires a copy of Dead Alchemist's grimoire. She hasn't understood the Method yet.
# The Witch finds out that there are stories about Dead Alchemist among people of the Shelves and installs herself there.
# The Witch hears stories about the Method and decides she should train some people.
# MC Professor discovers one of Dead Alchemist's power focuses.






# MEGA TIMELINE:
## 2009-05-12: Dead Alchemist - a mage, member of the magic undeground and an alchemist -, living in Sahamwa ("it's an old name"), tracks the Artifact to TOWN and plans a trip there to within the next few days. During a game of golf, meets and bonds with Fleeing Deadbeat Dad (a widowed psychiatrist with two daughters) during a game of golf, without knowing he was from TOWN. Fleeing Deadbeat Dad was there for a conference. Dead Alchemist has a young son, at the time - Accidental Mage Thief - that doesn't suspect the identity of his father.
## 2009-05-14: Dead Alchemist goes to TOWN to acquire the Artifact at the Antiquary, owned by Sleazy Diner Owner. Fleeing Deadbeat Dad was also at the store, at the time, and interested in the Artifact, but quickly lets it go in favor of Dead Alchemist. Deciding that the meeting is a matter of Fate, Dead Alchemist decides to invest in the connection. Noticing that the Artifact must be more valuable than expected, Sleazy Diner Owner suggests he may hold up to it for a little longer (for a better appraisal). Dead Alchemist pays an exorbitant price for the Artifact to take it away immediately.
## 2009-05-16: Fleeing Deadbeat Dad tries to invite Uptight Nurse MILF for dinner without success. Gently declined.
## 2009-05-24: Sleazy Diner Owner uses the money from the Artifact sale to buy the Diner. Tries to woo Gym Trainer MILF without success. Brutally shutdown.
## 2009-06-06: With the use of the Artifact, Dead Alchemist finishes the *ELIXIR* and starts testing the *METHOD*. With the Method, he believes he will be able to permanently change subject minds and with the Elixir, this should be possible to be used by non-mages. He quickly decides it is too risky to test the Method in town - at Sahamwa -, and decides that it may be better to test it at TOWN. Dead Alchemist believes he should prepare a legacy for his son, but must do it secretly. He starts preparing a book with his findings. He also stars sending dreams to his son, teaching him a little about the "magic underground".
## 2009-06-11: Dead Alchemist meets to Fleeing Deadbeat Dad and reveals the "magic underground" to him - breaking rules - and, after a first demonstration with the Elixir, he is convinced. They decide setup a *SECRET* lab at the Teaching Hospital, where Fleeing Deadbeat Dad works.
## 2009-06-13: Fleeing Deadbeat Dad uses the Elixir to have unprecedented success with girls. The effects are still, at that time, only temporary.
## 2009-06-18: Fleeing Deadbeat Dad first tests the Elixir on Uptight Nurse MILF.
## 2009-07-20: Dead Alchemist, working together with Fleeing Deadbeat Dad, a Psychiatrist, perfects the Method. The method consists of using several Elixir - magic potions usable by non-mages - and psychology (behavioral sciences) to condition a person to a given behavior. The conditioning works incredibly fast and is very stable.
## 2009-07-30: Fleeing Deadbeat Dad uses the Elixir to enchant Uptight Nurse MILF. Their relationship is consolidated.
## 2009-08-22: Fleeing Deadbeat Dad uses the Elixir to get the position of director at Teaching Hospital.
## 2009-08-25: Fleeing Deadbeat Dad sells the Elixir to a few people in the Upper Shelves. This is done with Dead Alchemist's agreement to start gaining political influence in town.
## 2009-10-30: Fleeing Deadbeat Dad uses the Elixir to cheat some money out of drug dealers.
## 2009-11-02: Dead Alchemist and Fleeing Deadbeat Dad conspire to create the Finishing School municipal law as a lab where they intend to conduct their experiments.
## 2009-12-01: Fleeing Deadbeat Dad marries Uptight Nurse MILF with whom he had already been dating for months. She bonds surprisingly well with his daughters (Prideful Hot Babe is 12 at the time and Innocent Schoolgirl Teen is 10).
## 2010-03-05: Dead Alchemist, feeling he is drawing too much attention to himself at Sahamwa, decides to permanently move to TOWN. The laws for the Finishing School and moving all other schools out of town are already in place. Dead Alchemist moves into the HOTEL.
## 2010-05-01: Dead Alchemist moves into the School Lodging to become a teacher the next period. Fearing his enemies are closing in, he prepares a crystal device to register some memory and instructions for his son, for whom he has kept sending instructional dreams for the previous several months.
## 2010-05-14: Dead Alchemist sets up a meeting at Hotel with some drug dealers, wanting to clear up Fleeing Deadbeat Dad's mistakes.
## 2010-05-25: THE EVENT. Dead Alchemist is killed in an explosion at the Hotel by people from the "magic underground" who thought he was living at the hotel (and, therefore, did not investigate the town, to find the lab, the school lodging and the connection to Fleeing Deadbeat Dad). The explosion starts a fire at the hotel and several debris hit people on the streets. A lot of people (over 100) die, including people in a conference at the hotel, leaving several orphans. It also marked the hotel as a "bad" place. The city is scared for years to come.
## 2010-05-26: Nerdy Alchemist, 11 at the time, having lost both parents in the Event, moves in with Motherly B&B Owner and her two daughters (Insecure Schoolgirl Teen is 10 and Bitchy Lesbian Babe is 12).
## 2010-05-27: Fleeing Deadbeat Dad finally notices Dead Alchemist has disappeared and links him to The Event. Very scarred, he does not know if the explosion was caused by drug dealers or by the "magic undeground", which deeply scares him. He prepares to flee.
## 2010-05-28: Sleazy Diner Owner, noticing how successful Fleeing Deadbeat Dad has suddenly become approaches him to blackmail him. Very scared, fearing Sleazy Diner Owner may be working with the drug dealers, he offers to buy his silence with several doses of the Elixir and instructions on how to use the Method to make a girl permanently his. Sleazy Diner Owner, also having taken more money, uses the Elixir on Gym Trainer MILF. He skimps on the usage, trying it - successfully - on several other women, but, eventually, he notices the effects are temporary and tries to finish the Method on Gym Trainer MILF. She eventually becomes his loving wife.
## 2010-05-30: Fleeing Deadbeat Dad flees the city, leaving his young wife and daughters behind. He thinks he is protecting them from any revenge that may befall him, but that is only rationalization.
## 2010-06-30: Scarred by the explosion and the strange events in TOWN, the drug cartel officially ceases operations in TOWN.
## 2010-07-28: Sub Student moves out of TOWN with his father after having lost his mother in The Event.

## 2017-03-08: MC Professor takes his sabbatical and starts traveling the world.

## 2018-06-01: Peeping Techie completes the sale of his software company and starts looking for a place to start his surveillance company.

## 2018-08-13: Sub Student arrives in town and moves in with Uptight Nurse MILF and her two daughters, Prideful Hot Babe and Innocent Schoolgirl Teen.
## 2018-08-14: Official start of game. Day 1. First day of school.
## 2018-08-25: Nerdy Alchemist comes back into town.
