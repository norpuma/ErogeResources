#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
Erica Dawson-Chalmers a rich and bitchy third year student. She is vain and proud, convinced she is the hottest girl in school and wanting everyone to recognize it. She doesn't want power, just adulation. She is doing well academically, although most teachers suspect she gets others to do her homework and cheats on tests. She is not a nice person, although she keeps a civil demeanor. In spite of her need for recognition of her beauty, she is not a very secure girl and, therefore, always avoided dating for more than a single date. Her father - Bartholomew Chalmers - spends most of his time out of home and gives her liberty and money to make up for it. She loves her material comforts, spends as much time as she can at the edge of her pool at home and abuses her maid - Angelina Calleras - at home. She is rather gauche with her wielding of money and influence, not like some of the other rich people at school, like Ashley Collins and Brandon Colton. She often organizes parties at home. She has an older sister whom she doesn't see as much. She triest to be digital influencer, although she doesn't put much work into it. Erica is cruel and gauche. She has a cruel streak and is amused by other people's misfortunes. She wields her beauty and power like a club, to get people to do what she wants. She is not against offering her money to get someone to humiliate themself or even to flash her breasts or buttocks for that purpose. She is not a cheerleader because she does not have the skills to be the captain and she refuses to stand in anyone's shadow.

  ## Role: F - Bitchy Rich Girl Teen
  ## References: ORIGINAL Westwick's Rich Cheerleader
  ## Gender: Female.
  ## Status at start of game: Established.
  ## Age: 18
  ## Inspirations: ??? Peta Jensen, Jessa Rhodes, August Ames and some other girls with nice pool scenes, that look gorgeous and have the potential to look like a rich bitch. Big breasts are desirable, preferably implants.
  ## Notes: Tease, Sub. She is a brat, spoiled and cruel. Dominant, Agressive, Cruel. She is the queen bee at school, under Machiavelic Schoolgirl Teen's influence. Machiavelic Schoolgirl Teen is, however, banned from her home for some reason (???why?) and, therefore, cannot use the pool. She is Division Manager MILF's younger sister, from a different marriage and the two don't really see one another as sisters. Bitchy, rich, a cheerleader and very popular. She spent several years in a private school in Swtizerland where there were only girls and she is more than a little boy-crazy. She mistreats everyone including - and in particular - her maid - Vengeful Maid Babe. She loves her pool and is often there, sunbathing.
