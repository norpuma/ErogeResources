# Gerald Novak
  ## Role: M - Corrupt Cop
  ## References: ORIGINAL (from Norpuma's game "Witchcraft at Westwick" - bribable cop)
  ## Gender: Male.
  ## Status at start of game: Established.
  ## Age: 37
  ## Notes: Foil, Client, Helper. Long time cop in the sheriff department. Prejudiced. Never had patience for the "doing the right thing". Has been accepting bribes from drug smugglers from the beach for several years. Has a bad reputation in town and is considered "undateable". Has a reputation of a bad temper and having a small cock (it is actually average) - it was spread by Sex Shop Owner Babe with whom he had a fling that ended very badly before she accepted herself as a lesbian. Has no qualms about blackmailing people. Does not think he would ever be found out for bending the law. A potential antagonist for most protagonists. Long term friend with School Cook. Has a strong attraction to his friend's wife - Furniture Section MILF - and made some moves, but was rejected. She never told her husband. Was in school with Gym Chain Owner, Principal MILF, School Cook and Caf√© Owner. Wasn't initially approached by Cruel Dominant Neighborhood MILF as he has a nasty reputation, but would actually be a good addition to the Secret BDSM Club. A misogynist and a misanthrope.
  ## Lives at: Sherwood Apartments Building: Novak Apartment. @Aquarius Drive.
  ## Works at: Sheriff Department. @St Nicholas Street.
  ## Studies at: None
  ## Links: Husband to Furniture Section MILF. Childhood friend to Corrupt Cop. Classmate to Principal MILF. Employee to Principal MILF.
