### History:
#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
Brittney is a smart and bitchy third year student. She is a hacker with no respect for authority or the norms, which, coupled with her attitude, makes her unpopular with both students and teachers. Brittney is very arrogant about her smarts and acts condescending and impatient with most people. This helps drive people away from her. Brittney is a loner, but she also feels lonely and frustrated with her lot. She wishes she had people to share her experiences and her worries with, but she does not know how to stop driving people away. Brittney is actually concerned with people's feelings, she is just not very good at reading or mapping them. Brittney has a younger sister, ???who???, whom she believes to be smarter and hotter than she is. Her young sister is charming and sociable and Brittney feels that she is wasting her smarts. They are often at odds with one another. Brittney wants to be independent to better ignore societal norms, but she depends on her parents' money to keep her relatively comfortable lifestyle.
