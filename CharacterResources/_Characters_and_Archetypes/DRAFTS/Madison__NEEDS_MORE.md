# Madison (Maddie) Platter
## Role: F - Timid Nerd Girl
  ## Gender: Female.
  ## Reference: Storyline: ???. Personality: ???. Appearance: Harem Hotel - Kali (big breasts, glasses, curly black hair); Eliz Jane (porn).
  ## Age: 18
  ## Status at start of game: Recent arrival.
  ## School Role: Timid Nerd.
  ## Personality: Good student, conformist, unpopular. Very smart. Craves recognition (academic and popularity). Submissive.
  ## Notes: Comes from a blue-collar family and needs jobs to have money. Great at computers. Hated being seen as a lowly nerd in school and wants to become popular in Finishing School. Working as a waiter at the restaurant. Lives at the School Lodgings, even though she has a family member in the District. Her younger sister is a brat and gets away with it. She acts like a brat with her brother - School Counselor (Harold). She wants approval from the popular people at school and tries to enter their social circles. She tries to act confident, but is still very insecure about her likeability. She has had sex only once, with a boy, and it was not a good experience. She wonders if she is a lesbian. She likes fashion, but not with enough dedication to start a career with that or even to have a distinct look. She likes pets, but has never had one as her father - and her brother - has alergies. She has a good relationship with her father and his second wife with whom he has a younger child of 13 whom she considers a brother - School Counselor Guy - does not have that kind of relationship. Has a strong fantasy of having sex with a black man.
  ## Canon: She will take on dog-walking to complement her earnings. She will be abused by Bitchy Rich Girl Girl () and the pranking twins (). She will not be immediately protected by the Machiavelic Schoolgirl Girl (), but that can happen.
    ### Progress: Tries out for the cheerleader squad and is humiliated. She starts dating AV Nerd Boy (Billy). Her boss wants her to dress more scantily/provocatively/sexy, she refuses and gets fired. Has sex with her boyfriend - AV Nerd Boy (Billy) - for the first time. She can be made to walk Bitchy Rich Girl Girl () as a bitch on a leash. Approached by (???who?), a friendly female who tells her she is very smart, who tells her she is actually pretty behind her glasses, who tells her she has very cute breasts. Hacks into the Principal MILF (Catherina)'s computer for one of her rivals. Is seduced by Athletic School Boy (Lincoln). Convinces boyfriend to "expand his sexual horizons" and has sex with Athletic School Boy (Lincoln) in front of him. Seduces boyfriend into admitting he loves her in spite of everything and makes him her cuckold. Starts enjoying abusing cuckold boyfriend.

    ### AV Nerd Boy (Billy): boyfriend. The most she can get. Seems to not value her too much (but it is okay, she doesn't think she has that much value, yet). Has time for her and is smart enough to understand her. Not very romantic.
      #### Wishes: Would like him to be a little more athletic. Would like him to help her think through her options to become popular. Dreams of him starting at the gym, becoming buff, revealing that he is the heir to a fortune and was pretending to be pauper to find a suitable bride.
