##### Narrative:
##### Bulleted:
- Smart. Manipulative. Ambitious. Cruel. Patient. Cynic.
- Smart and amoral, she is careful with her public image, seeming always a nice girl, but actually willing to break anyone to get ahead.
- Ashley Collins is a second year student, popular and one of the richest students at school. She acts like a nice person, but she has a different personality depending on her interactions.
- Ashley amassed a flock of followers (${Jessica Norris}, ${Valerie Norris}, ${Kenneth Clarington}, ${Matthew Emerson}, ${Gerrod Dansen}, ${Elsa Templeton}) and people fawning over her by strategically distributing money and favors.
- Ashley is careful to be well liked by her teachers. She coud be a good student, but doesn't see much value in that.

- Ashley dated a few guys (???) and ended up with ${Matthew Emerson}, as the most strategic, even though she is visibly cold in her interactions with him.
- Ashley sees herself as the queen-bee at school, but actually is aware that her position is challenged by ${Emanuelle Pendleton}.
- Ashley sees herself as independent and moved out from home (to spite her daddy) and into an all-female house with ${Kelly Lexington} and ${Elsa Templeton}.
- Ashley loves manipulating people and molding them to her liking. One of her greatst successes is ${Elsa Templeton} who she turned into something akin to her maid at home and at school. ${Gerrod Dansen} is her dragon to unleash on whomever physically threatens her. And ${Jessica Norris} is her voice, saying the nastiest stuff she doesn't allow herself to say and embarrassing or outright humiliating people who displease Ashley.
- Ashley finds ${Erica Dawson-Chalmers} too gauche. Ashley doesn't yet have a way to reshape her, however. But she would like to bring the other girl down a couple of pegs.
