# Jeff (Jeffrey/Jefferson) Clearing
## Role: M - Policeman Geezer
  ## Gender: Male.
  ## Reference: Storyline: ???. Personality: ORIGINAL (based on the sugar daddy of some of Norpuma's petplay games and stories). Appearance: ???.
  ## Age: 47
  ## Status at start of game: Established.
  ## Enclave Role: Chief of Police; Concilor.
  ## Personality: Consciencious and dedicated. Acts serious and secure in public. Needing to please. Feeling like he could have more if only he was better. Feels like an impostor among the Councilors.
  ## Notes: Worked his way up the security team by sheer dedication and competence. Responsible for the outside security (very good at it) and internal security (not very good at it, assumes people to be too good). Took in his niece (???who?) two months before as she wanted to leave the students lodging and his brother-in-law and his wife (he used to be married to the girl's aunt, the sister to their father) remain in the Foundation District with their many children. Ascended to the Council. People have figured him out since he ascended and politically savvy Councilors manipulate him all the time. They trust and respect him in outside security policy, however. Often bribed with *dates* (not even sex, most of the time). Starts very embarrassed by seeing her sexually, but it gets beyond his control and he starts fantasizing of bedding her. 
  ## Canon: Is becoming frantic - desperate - obsessing about his niece sexually. She realizes it and makes him into her "suggar daddy". Is too embarrased to join the ceremonies at the Sex Temple. He learns of the Elixir and sees a real opportunity there. He refuses to use it on his niece as he really cares for her. Gets his niece all kinds of gifts, including slaves. Uses his position to turn a guy he was afraid would date his niece into a slave (one of the first pets). His other niece comes to the District. Initially she stays at the Lodgings, but he starts desiring her too and brings her to his place. He gets a chance to fuck a girl with the Elixir and gets hooked. He uses it on his nieces and becomes a real jerk about it. His nieces conspire to bring him down and he is exposed as "wanton". Becomes his niece's informal slave and older niece ascends to having influence in the Council.

  ## Romantic Ideal: Beautiful young woman needing his protection and praising his strength and wisdom as she tries to constantly tease and seduce him until finally, inevitably, giving in and being bedded.
  ## Exciting Ideal: His nieces as they need his protection and admit that only he can properly protect and please them.
  ## Ideal Submissive: His nieces tempting and teasing him until they admit they really, really need him and are willing to do anything for him (including pleasing one another).
  ## Idealized Self: Leader of the Council raised by acclamation by everyone he has done favors for, desired by women and protector of all.
