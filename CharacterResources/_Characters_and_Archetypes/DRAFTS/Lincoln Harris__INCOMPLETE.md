### History
#### Background (story before this point)
- Idealistic. Ambitious. Confident. Slightly cruel. Insecure about not knowing what he wants to be. Insecure about not having his father full approval. Looking for an easier life than he has had.
- A conformist, Lincoln tries to win by using the system, not breaking it.
- Lincoln is a black male teenager with a big cock and an athlete's body.
- Lincoln Harris is one of the hottest guys at school. He is an athlete, well liked by the coach - ??? - and popular. Lincoln is a good student, liked by most teachers, on his second year and has a reputation as a nice guy. He comes from a simple family and likes to play the guitar. He doesn't have much time to date, however, with so many activities.
- Lincoln is struggling with chemistry AND history at the start of the year.
- Lincoln is son to ??? - a blue collar worker as a landscape artist -, who has high hopes for him as a musician. He used to be a better student and a more dedicated artist before he moved out of the Foundation District with his father and met his young uncle - ???, a musician who ocasionally helps out Lincoln's father in the landscaping business - who introduced him to alcohol and planted in him a genuine curiosity for drugs (just pot, actually).
- His mother left when he was 6 and he has had no contact with her after that.
- Lincoln is not a bad person, but he feels he had to be serious his whole life and sometimes likes to let lose after so many years - which can make him slightly cruel, or, at least, selfish.
- Lincoln does not have a girlfriend and only limited sexual experience (drunken sex with ??? and a couple of hookups after that; a couple of blowjobs and fingering from ??? and ???), although he tries to hide that under a more confident and blasé demeanor.

# Lincoln (Link) Harris
## Role: M - Athletic School Boy
  ## Gender: Male.
  ## Reference: Storyline: ???. Personality: ???. Appearance: Appearance: Louie Smalls (from Blacked.com).
  ## Age: 20
  ## Status at start of game: Established.
  ## Enclave Role: ???
  ## Personality: Idealistic. Ambitious. Confident. Slightly cruel. Insecure about not knowing what he wants to be. Insecure about not having his father full approval. Looking for an easier life than he has had.
  ## Notes: Popular, good student, conformist. Black man. He has a big cock. A promising student at the High School and a great athlete. Well liked by the coach - Jerk High School Coach Man (). He is son to Landscaper Silvered (), who has high hopes for him as an artist. He used to be a better student and a more dedicated artist before he moved out of the Foundation District with his father and met his young uncle - Struggling Musician Guy () - who introduced him to alcohol and planted in him a genuine curiosity for drugs (pot, actually). He is not a bad person, but he feels he had to be serious his whole life and sometimes likes to let lose in his last year of high school - which can make him slightly cruel. He does not have a girlfriend and only limited sexual experience, although he tries to hide that under a more confident and blasé demeanor. His mother left when he was 6 and he has had no contact with her after that. He is struggling with chemistry AND history at the start of the year.
  ## Canon: Temple priestesses will want him as a bull/stud, but his father - Landscaper Silvered () - will forbid it. His father will be approached by Business Silvered (Mike) to be his spy at the school, but his fater will not agree to it. Without his father knowledge, he will volunteer and enter an agreement. That will make him take a much more active role in school politics and become a BBC Superiority agent. Moves into the School Lodgings (or the Hotel) after a fight with his father, to become a better agent. Will discover the School Counselor Guy () domination and find out that he has access to the Hypno Lights. He will try to get control of the Hypno Lights for Business Silvered (Mike). Will ask for a slave and get it. When he brings her home, will have a fight with his father. Will not discover his father is working at the Temple until late in the game. Will seduce Timid Nerd Girl (Madison) and, then, dominate her. Using her, will gain control of AV Nerd Boy (). Will seduce and, then dominate, Head Cheerleader Girl (Bella) to use her as a pawn to compromise other people at school. Gains control of the Wallflower Boy (Alec) using Head Cheerleader Girl (Jessie) and turns him against the Principal MILF (Catherina), therefore, finally, gaining control of the school and the Hypno-Lights for Business Silvered (Mike).

  ## Romantic Ideal: Hot, smart girl who would make his father proud to meet. Someone he could make into a partner on his way to success.
  ## Exciting Ideal: Hot, slightly slutty, college girl who he would steel from his uncle. She would keep telling him how much better he is than anyone else she has ever had.
  ## Ideal Submissive: Popular and hot schoolgirl turned submissive to him, humiliating herself and begging for his cock in front of the whole school.
  ## Idealized Self: He does not know and that makes him insecure.
  ## Dark Reflection: Owned sexual object. Used only for his body. Displaying athletic/physical prowess and his big cock for others to use for their profit - like a female coach who would use him as her start athlete and getting him to fuck her and to seduce girls into coming service her, but actually taking all the credit for everything.
  ## Corruption elements: Uncertain about what he wants in life. Looking for his father's approval. Insecure about his mental prowess. Wanting to be lazy. Looking for an easy path in life.
