#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
Elsa Templeton is a timid second year student and part of Ashley Collins' crowd. Elsa is quiet and introspective, mostly following Ashley's instructions at school and often acting as her maid. She is an okay student and a nerd, although she keeps her hobbies discreetly at school. She likes to write fanfics, poems and music in her free time, which is mostly late at night. She actually has a very dominating side and something of a cruel streak, but lacks the opportunities to express those, except under Ashley's orders. If she found someone she could dominate, she would be overjoyed and quite cruel. Elsa comes from a working class family. One of the few activities she has away from Ashley is drama club, which Ashley "allows" her to attend to keep an eye on the nerds. She lives with Ashley and Vera Lexington in an all-female house. She has a stronger sex drive than most, but can't express it in her social circles, but the nerds of the drama club find her a little slutty.
##### Bulleted:
- Social submissive. She acts very submissively in public, sheltered by her clique's leader. She is subservient, acting like a servant, attending orders and unvoiced desires.
- Private switch. She believes in social norms and acts submissively because she thinks it is her station in her social circles. She dreams of being demanding and cruel to a submissive of her own, though.
- Discreet nerd. She likes nerd activities, but is very discreet about them, because that would be disapproved in her social circles.
- Creative artist. She likes to write stories, poems and lyrics to music, but she doesn't let others know about that.
- Lives with her "mistress".

# Chloe Hastings
  ## Role: F - Timid Country Teen
  ## References: ORIGINAL
  ## Gender: Female.
  ## Status at start of game: Established. Arrives 3 months previously.
  ## Age: 19
  ## Inspirations: Appearance: Chloe Foster or Alex Grey or Ariana Marie or Chloe Amour. Attitude: ???
  ## Notes: A young woman with a suppressed dominant side. She came into town to study at the Teaching College as a nurse and ended up living with Rich College Babe who quickly dominated her. She was taken to the BDSM club by Rich College Babe to be trained. She accepts her position as a sub, but dreams of one day becoming a dom. She believes there is a hierarchy of dominance related to time in the milieu. She is often taken to the Shelves by Rich College Babe but often has to perform as a plaything and something worthy of being displayed. She will become Innocent Puppy Owner Teen's best friend when she comes into town. If Innocent Puppy Owner Teen ever becomes jealous of her, she will be turned into a little bitch (puppy girl). She comes from a small town, nearby. She was raised in a farm. She finds she has a lot in common with Innocent Puppy Owner Teen. She doesn't have a job as Rich College Babe prefers her as a full-time live-in slave and maid when she is not studying. She will be very timid around Pliable Sweetheart Teen when she first arrives as she is not comfortable being shown around, yet - but will be put on display by Rich College Babe nonetheless. She will act sweetly with Weak College Guy at first, but she will do whatever her mistress tells her to and will abuse him sweetly. If Weak College Guy ever tries to domine, she will act forceful. One way or another, sweetly or harshly, she will try to dominate Weak College Guy in time, when she decides he is simply lower in the totem pole.
