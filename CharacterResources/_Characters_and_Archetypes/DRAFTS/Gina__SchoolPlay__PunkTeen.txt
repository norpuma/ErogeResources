# Gina (Regina) Green
  ## Role: F - Rebel Punk Teen
  ## Gender: Female.
  ## Reference: History: ???. Personality: ???. Appearance: Pornstar Gina Valentina OR Pornstar Jynx Maze.
  ## Age: 19
  ## Status at start of game: Established.
  ## School Role: Punk Girl.
  ## Personality: Rebel, bad student, unpopular. Feels abandoned and feels the need for discipline (easy to dominate).
  ## Notes: She is a smoker. She is a smart girl, but a bad student. Her father had little patience with her for the last year at the Foundation District (her mother was there until she was 15, then, she moved out for work and her father was the only one who stayed with her). Her father remained behind at the Foundation District to take care of her younger sister. Her father is something of a wimp. She was very happy to meet with her mother again, when coming to the District, but her mother was distract, absent and easy to irritate - her mother, Latin Nurse MILF () is under the influence of the BBC Grand Master (). She rebels when she finds her mother so different than expected. She feels abandoned, in need of attention and discipline, but she was raised to be strong and she will only respect someone she finds stronger than her (that overcomes her rebel ways). She lost her virginity to School Beefcake Boy (Connor) - both drunk at a party, almost an year ago - and does not put much stock in romance. She kissed a girl - (Molly) - and liked it. She admits she could fuck a girl, but never did it and never actually felt a real desire for it. She is willing to have sex at most occasions, but social pressures prevent her from doing it too often. She goes to the Dance Club to find sex partners - but has limited success. She thinks the Temple of Ishtar is bullshit (influenced by her mother who is influenced by BBC Grand Master). Loves photography, but hasn't had time for it in a long time. Went to the A/V Club - where she met A/V Nerd (Billy) - for a month in her freshman year, but quickly gave up.
  ## Canon: She is a big problem for the Principal MILF (Catherina). She is sent to the School Counselor Guy (Harold). She is the first victim of the Hypnotic Lights. She becomes a oral fixated slut.
    ### Progress: Becomes oral fixated slut. Becomes a dom's whore. Not having any job, her rebellious side will lead her to become one of the first slaves by debt. She will be bought by Principal MILF who wants some revenge on her and all the trouble she has caused and who convinces herself she is doing it to help a troubled young girl.
    ### Femdom Wins: Becomes the Principal MILF (Catherina) submissive pain and humiliation slut. An anal whore addicted to sucking cock (meat or rubber). Develops a milk fetish.

      ##### Wishes: Would like her to admit she is having a lot of sex and is something of a slut. Would like her mother to pay some attention to her. Dreams, but will not admit it out loud, of her mother becoming a model mothers, staying at home a lot, baking cakes and cookies for her, checking her homework and giving her some punishment for her misbehavior. Dreams, but will not admit it to herself, of her mother introducing her to her secret lover and him becoming a dominating father figure, fucking her and her mother.
    ### Principal MILF (Catherina): enemy. Is the target of much of her bile and rebellious actions as she pays attention and tries to discipline her. Is often hounding her and berating her for her bad behavior, but has little means of effectively punishing her.
      #### Wishes: Would like her to stop hounding her and just leave her be. Dreams of being disciplined by her and having to become a "good girl". Dreams of her taking her home and becoming her new mother - in a lesbian, incestuous relationship.
    ### School Counselor Guy (Harold): influencer. Has to see her (Gina) for her misbehavior. Actually listen to her and gains a level of influence over her for that. Uses Hypno Lights on her to make her his slut.
      #### Wishes: Would like him to spend more time with her, listening to her. Would like him to stop trying to "improve" her. Dreams of him meeting her mother, the two clicking and him becoming her "real daddy".

# Storyline:
Gina has been acting out for several months. She managed to get through her freshman year and into sophomore year, but barely.

She doesn't really care anymore, though.

Principal Chatnam stumbles on her smelling of cigarettes a couple of times and confronts her, but she simply denies smoking with a sardonic smile. Then, during one of Professor Taylor's lectures, she made an inconvenient question (history class, something about how demons took over the world, an embarrassing question). When told by the teacher to talk about it after class, she kept raising her hand and asking the question again and again. She intend to inconvenience and embarrass. She was sent to the principal.

Gina ignored the warnings and recommendations of the principal. There was no weight to the threats. She would have *liked* being sent home - and the principal confides, later, to the new School Counselor, that she can't actually fail any of her students, by District Council's orders.

Gina acts out again during one of Coach Hauser's classes. She kept causing fouls until she was benched. She didn't break any of the rules, but she was trying to be disruptive again. Since the Finishing School has a new School Counselor, she is sent to Mr Platter.

Gina goes see the counselor. Mr Platter asks her a couple of questions and she states that she is required to sit with the counselor, but not to answer any of his stupid questions. He asks a couple more questions, but she just sits there, in front of him, arms crosses, defiant grin on her face and silent. He tries to reach her and even sees her tick to one of the questions (???about smoking?), but he realizes she is smart and sufficiently in control to challenge him. That's when he tests the Hypno Lights.

After a few flashes, Gina changes her posture. She sits up straight, but seeming relaxed, and looking at the counselor with a vacant stare. Mr Platter looks at her, wondering, but tells her she needs to treat him with more respect. She makes a grimace, but doesn't dispute him. He tells her it is disrespectful to ignore him and she lowers her eyes and answers with "Yes, sir." He is surprised but tries to make the most out of the situation. He asks if she will keep disrupting classes and she answers with "Yes, sir," no disrespect in her tone. He tells he has to, but she disputs the fact. Always respectfully. He realizes he may have induced a hypnotic trance on her. He tries the lights again, but they don't flash (he, later, realizes they were recharging). He tries to give her another command, but she doesn't accept it.

Counselor finds Gina smoking close to his window the next day. He tells her to come see him. She does, sullenly. He tries to reach her, she stays respectful, but doesn't obey. He tries the Hypno Lights again. They work. He tells her to lift her blouse. She does. She asks "Why did you tell me to do that?", he answers with "To see if you would obey. And you did!" She says she doesn't know why she did it, but that she won't be doing it again. Counselor tells her to lift her blouse again and she resists the command with a vindicated smile. Counselor tries the lights again, but they don't work. He realizes he will only be able to give Gina one command per day.

The next time Gina is in his office, he uses the Hypno Lights and tells her she must always obey him. She has a look of profound concentration on her face and, then, she shakes her head. He realizes he has gone too far. That he needs to change her in smaller steps. He tells her she will come see him everyday after class and she says she will. From this point on, everyday Gina comes and she is changed by the lights.

He tells Gina she must always answer him honestly and not feel embarrassed by her answers. That command works. He starts asking questions.

Gina has a terrible weekend with her mother and she acts out on Monday. Right at the start of the week, Gina is disrespectful to the principal and Ms Chatnam goes complain to the counselor.






        - Gina misbehaves in class and in class and is sent to the school counselor.
        - Counselor tests hypno-light on Gina. Tells her to treat him with respect. She does. Counselor finds that only one command can be given per day.
        - Counselor tells Gina to take lift her blouse.
        - Counselor tells Gina to feel natural parading around naked around him.
        - Counselor tells Gina to suck on his cock.
        - Counselor tells Gina to feel a constant desire to "suck".
        - Gardner finds Gina smoking. She promptly offers to suck his dick so that he won't tell anyone.
        Gina is the counselor's cocksucking slut.
            Make Gina suck at any time.
            Make Gina service with pussy and ass at any time.
            Gina stops smoking in public.
            Gina stops misbehaving in class.
            Her priorities do not matter.
            Her body is not hers, it is your property to use as you will.
            Make Gina whore herself.
            Her body is not hers, it is your property to barter as you will (pimping her out).
            -> May still become the gardner's BBC slut.
            -> May still be converted into a femsub to a femdom (inspired by Bonnie Rotten's Brazzers scene with Gina Valentina)
