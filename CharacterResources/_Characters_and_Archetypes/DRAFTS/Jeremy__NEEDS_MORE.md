#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
Jeremy Taller is a second year student and part of the school nerds. He is not as quite as some of the other nerds and a little more sociable, but he is still one of the preferred targets of Chris Dansen - the school bully. Jeremy is often hanging out with William Shine and Grace Walton. He likes the arcades, the House of Arts and the beach. He is a little more athletic than most others in his clique, enjoying a good run, but not being dedicated enough to join one of the teams. He is a curious guy and his curiosity put him in trouble on more than one occasion. He also sometimes speaks faster than he thinks and has landed in trouble with people for that in the past. ??? one of the teachers at school dislikes Jeremy for some of his remarks the previous year, but he now tolerates the nerd, trying to forget the previous year's incident. Jeremy has a bratty younger sister - ??? - and a mother - ??? - that always takes his sister's side. He tries to be polite and respectful to women and to stay in his mother's good graces, although that last is rather hard. Jeremy is only a decent student and most of his teachers aren't even aware of him.
