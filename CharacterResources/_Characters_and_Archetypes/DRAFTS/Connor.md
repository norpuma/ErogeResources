### History:
#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
Connor Remington is a third year student and one of the school's athletes. He is part of the popular clique, boyfriend to Emanuelle Pendleton. He likes to put on a bad boy attitude, but he is actually just a poser. He can be violent and something of a bully, although his girlfriend keeps him mostly in check. He dislikes Isabella Perkins for being too high and mighty, too condescendant and too judgemental, but he finds her very hot. Connor is not a bright student, but since he is not disruptive, most teachers tolerate him. He is not cruel, just entitled. Connor is better at pretending he is a nice guy to Emanuelle than at pretending to be a bad boy to the edgier crowd.
