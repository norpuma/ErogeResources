##### Narrative:
##### Bulleted:
- Newcomer drug lord. He is a drug pusher, successful and dangerous. He is also a newcomer, not well established in town, but carving out his empire.
- Smart, not genious. He is smart and knows how to proceed, but not smart to the point of not being possible to trick him. He tries to avoid mistakes of arrogance, but his success and power sometimes make it difficult.
- Cruel power and control freak. He loves power, especially feeling he has power over people. He likes to be smart about it, though, and put people in what he thinks are inescapable situations instead of just threatening them at the first occasion.
- Careful with aliens. He is not sure how much the aliens will tolerate his shady dealings, so he is careful not to go after much xenotech, he is also aware, however, that that is one of the most secure sources of power. He wants a deal for a new drug.

# Fred (Frederic/Freddie) Dubois
## Role: M - Drug Lord Silvered
  ## Gender: Male.
  ## Reference: Storyline: Davide from The Tyrant. Personality: Davide from The Tyrant. Appearance: ???Black Man, middle aged.
  ## Age: 36
  ## Status at start of game: Established.
  ## Enclave Role: Drug Lord.
  ## Personality: Confident, smooth, smart, tricky, ruthless, ambitious, patient.
  ## Notes: A minor drug dealer working in the Prudence District (for foreigners) and the Clarity District (performance drugs for engineers), he got into a partnership with Dead Alchemist () when he was first trying to get some financing to research the Elixir. He got to abuse Head Researcher MILF () for a time. He realized how dangerous she was as soon as she got free of her conditioning. He got ditched - and felt betrayed - when Dead Alchemist joined BBC Master Geezer (Isaiah) in the Justice District. He got the drug Horny Elixir from his partnership with Dead Alchemist and has expanded his influence in the Enclave based on that ever since. He got an enslaved minor witch producing the drug in the Prudence District and doesn't much worry about it. He poses as a liberator of repressed sex mores, but he admits to himself that he is in it for the money (and power) and principles be damned. He goes to the Temperance District to expand his business in the recreation area and gets a partnership with Town Bad Boy () to distribute both in the Finishing School and the Nightclub. He is desperate to find a way to influence the Council.
  ## Canon: He finds that Dead Alchemist () died and starts looking for his notes. He approaches Town Bad Boy () about distributing his Horny Elixir at the Finishing School. He prowls around the Dead Alchemist () family house before getting a foothold there and it scares them into getting greater security when Drone Security is introduced. Improves his operation at the Nightclub and meets School Dealer Girl (). He gets introduced into Dead Alchemist () family house by his employee School Dealer Girl (), by posing as her uncle. He gets control of the Improved Horny Elixir and used it on Lab Hottie (Carlie) to get control of her, turning her into a slut and making her study the Improved Horny Elixir for him. He takes control of the Dead Alchemist () family house members, but loses control of Lab Hottie (Carlie), who partners with Head Researcher MILF () to produce the Docility Drug used by the Enclave. He becomes master of the house, abusing Uptight Nurse MILF (), Innocent Girl (Lily) and Wimp Student Boy (). He turns Uptight Nurse MILF () and Wimp Student Boy () into slaves, but preserves Innocent Girl (Lily) as his little princess. He becomes an investor into one of the slavers companies. Innocent Girl (Lily) ends up turning against him and blackmailing him out of the Dead Alchemist () family house. He drugs and becomes the master of School Dealer Girl () and her lesbian lover Prideful Hottie (Allie), he enjoys punishing them for betraying him. Through subterfuge, he drugs Head Researcher MILF () with an Elixir and she becomes his slave, with Drug Lord Silvered (Fred) finally becoming the provider of the Docility Drug for the Enclave. After coming back to being Innocent Girl (Lily) master again for a time, he sells her as a pet slave to a breeder.

    ### BBC Wins: Master of the Dead Alchemist () family house, master fucker of Head Researcher MILF (), Lab Hottie (Carlie), School Dealder Girl () and Prieful Hottie (Allie). The first two work for him at the lab and organize demonstrations of lesbian love which he is happy to interrupt (Lab Birl Babe () often begs to suck his cock while servicing Head Researcher MILF ()) and the other two serve him at home where he fucks them to both girls' frustration. Wimp Student Boy () keeps serving him in both places and being humiliated by his big black cock. Often visits his new partner Business Silvered (Mike).
