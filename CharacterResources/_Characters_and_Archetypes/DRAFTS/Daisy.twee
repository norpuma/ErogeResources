$protagonist.name looks into the kitchen and find a petite young woman with straight black hair working there. Upon further examination, it is possible to notice her elongated ears and yellow eyes. She is reminescent of a fantasy elf!

When she sees $protagonist.name, she startles and drops the sponge she was using to wash some dishes and raises a hand to her pretty mouth.
