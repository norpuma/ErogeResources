Terry - Terrance Bloom - arrived at Horntown on a Friday afternoon.

Terry went to his aunt Sarah's house - the Thompson House. After last year, he has to finish high school here, in Horntown.

He talks with his aunt, with whom he hasn't talked in several years. She is beautiful, but strict. He is also introduced to his cousins, Angie and Maggie. Angie seems to dislike him from the start. Maggie is shy, but nice.

Terry, peeked by curiosity, wanders around the house at night. He finds that the girls all sleep with their doors open.

The first day of school was disturbing for Terry. He was impressed by how mnay cute girls there were in town.

He introduced himself to a couple of the most beautiful ones, but he was laughed at.

He got a little distracted, during class, by the cute girls and his hot teacher - Miss Sungrove - berated him.

On his way home, Terry helped a girl who tripped and dropped some of her papers. He was tempted, but he didn't stare at her panties when he got the chance. She was grateful and told him she was called Mia.

Terry found that if he wanted to perform the chores Miss Thompson had assigned him, he wouldn't have much free time.

Terry spent some time playing video games. It helped him relax a little.

Overcome with sexy thoughts, Terry masturbated during hte night.

Before going to the Thompson's house, he went to a caf√© and tried to talk with a cute girl with a tattoo he was under the impression he recognized. She fled from him and some older guy yelled at Terry.
