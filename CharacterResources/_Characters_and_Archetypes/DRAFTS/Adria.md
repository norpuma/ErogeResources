### History:
#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
Adria Rosen is a cute, nerdy, first year good student. She is a dedicated student and one of the best in her class. She is polite and considerate, making her a preferred student by most teachers. She is unaware that her mother - Carmen Rosen - is secretly dating her activist lesbian teacher Alexa Nabakova. She has studied with Edward Surn for some time and admires his drive, even though she despises his excessive ambition and his concerns with social standing. She thinks he can learn to be better and may see him as a "project". She is almost completely unaware of her sexuality and her cuteness, although she is not very insecure with her appearance - she mostly doesn't pay it any attention. Adria is, mostly, a sticker for the rules and very conformant and dutiful.
