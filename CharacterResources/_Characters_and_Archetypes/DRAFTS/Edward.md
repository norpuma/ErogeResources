#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
Edward Surn is a first year student, a nerd and an okay student. In spite of having different names, he is a younger brother to the twins Jessica and Valerie Norris. He lived with his mother and a younger brother, Dwight Surn. He moves in with his sisters and his demanding father - Quentin Norris. He is entitled and ambitious, always having believed that he deserved more than his lot in life. He doesn't want to be popular as he believes himself above most of those people. He enjoys nerdy activities, but resents having to hang out with other nerds. He dreams of developing super powers to climb up in life and gain recognition, meanwhile he tries to apply himself to his studies to try to create something as a scientist. He realizes a nerdy Adria Rosen is actually cute and thinks it would be okay to date her. Edward is teased and abused by his sisters at home, especially by Jessica, and his father doesn't really care about him, showering much more attention and approval on the girls. His fater expects him to get a job and gives him what he sees as a small stipend. Edward Surn starts as quite unpopular both due to his nerdy inclinations and haughty attitude. He is often seen as a creep at school as he keeps ogling girls. He is not attractive. He believes becoming friends with William Shine may give him access to some recording equipment.
