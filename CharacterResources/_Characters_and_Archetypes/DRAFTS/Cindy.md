### History:
#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
Cindy is a young woman trying to display a confident demeanor, but actually quite insecure about her appearance and her choices. She used to be a nerd at school and she still tries to tell herself that that is okay. She works as a salesperson at ???where???. She has a fiend working for the police, ???who???. She has a steady boyfriend, ???who???. Cindy has a very positive attitude, upbeat and sunny, trying to make everything plyaful and acting enthusiastic. She feels somewhat inhibitted by public displays of affection, though. Cindy is a homophobe in the literal sense, she is scared of lesbianism (deep down she is a little tempted, actually). Cindy has a follower personality, she has a hard time taking control or even making big decisions, she usually relies on family and friends for that. She doesn't hold her alcohol well, but she is not good at realizing it. She can do stupid things when intoxicated. She more often feels guilty than entitled and tends to want to please others. She is close to her young sister, ???, who, actually, has a very good head on her shoulders.
##### Bulleted:
- Good girlfriend. She does her best to try to be a good girlfriend, but she expects recognition for her troubles.
- Guileless and influenceable. She does a lot of what a person she trust says.
- Strong conformist. She goes by societal norms whenever she can. She follows the trend and the rules.
- Uptight and suppressed. She tries to ignore her sexuality, doing sex mostly because that is what is expected of couples for genuinely wanting to. She tries, and has trouble, suppressing her attraction to girls.
- Changed by alcohol. She does not become a different person when drunk, but she tends to speak her mind more and to reveal more about herself than she usually does. She kissed a girl while drunk and really liked it.
- Entitled. She is not demanding, but she often feels entitled and becomes upset.
