#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
Alec is a discreet and timid school boy in his first year. Alec lives at the school dorms, but he dislikes having to share a bedroom and dislikes the rules. Alec is looking for a way out of the school dorms. Alec comes from a blue collar family. Alec has had a life-long crush on Allie, but he assumed she never noticed him because he is one year her junior. Alec is unaware of Allie's videogame predilections. Alec likes to watch videos online, it is not uncommon for those videos to be tutorials, but they are often just funny videos. Alec is very quiet and has taught himself how to palm items and pick pockets. He got caught, once, and got a beating. He has avoided picking pockets since then. Alec is very curious about lock picking. Alec acts polite, but that is mostly out of fear as he is, deep down, a coward who avoids confrontations at all costs. Alec is a submissive at heart, avoid confrontations, risks or making decisions. Alec hopes no bullies will notice him at this new school of his. He is quite amoral, although he doesn't admit it even to himself. Alec doesn't have any friends, although he used to be close to cousin that he hasn't seen since said cousin left Foundation. Alec doesn't take many risks, but he is trying to convince himself to be more daring to live life more fully. Alec doesn't take much care of his appearance. He is not hideous, just unkempt, but still in a forgettable manner.
