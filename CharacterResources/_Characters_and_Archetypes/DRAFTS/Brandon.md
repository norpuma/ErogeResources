#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
Brandon Colton is a third year student and a modest teenager with a lot of money. Brandon is the son of a proeminent family, but he is modest and discreet. He acts nice around school and is a little bit naive, frustrated that no one ever gave him the chance he deserved, even though he is a nice guy. He is strongly attracted to Isabella Perkins, but she never noticed he exists, even though he has helped her in several small projects around school. Brandon tries not to be judgemental, even though he finds Erica Dawson-Chalmers vulgar in her displays of wealth and Ashley Collins manipulations rather cruel. He avoids associating with Ashley Collins' crowd. He is something of a loner, with no close friends. He is not nerdy enough for the nerds, unable to follow up on all their nerdy subjects and finding all of them boring. He is not sure he should keep being an exemplary student, unsure it will bring him what he wants. Brandon is something of a romantic, thinking he will find the girl of his dreams at some point and that it will make every thing make sense. Brandon's sister - ???Lisa Colton - is a nice and wholesome girl dreaming of being a cheerleader. Their adopted mother is ??? and their father is ???.
