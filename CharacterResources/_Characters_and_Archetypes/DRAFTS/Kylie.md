He asks if she wants to break up. She is scarred by the prospect. He tells her, then, she should not complain. They end up having mind blowing sex.
    - Some guy shows up at her place. Michael calls her and tells her that since she said she has been having sex with other people "for him", she might as well fuck that guy he sent.

::Ashley - Introduction
<<set $ashley.introducedDay = $dayCount>>\
You have been about your routine at $town.name, doing your mindless job and playing some games to keep your sanity, when the central office contacts you.

The office bureaucrats have found $ashley.firstName $ashley.lastName, your young sister, was in town. She actually arrived before you and had been attending school.

Per $town.name's rules, she will move in with you. You are not thrilled. The two of you haven't lived together in a long while, but the last few interactions you had were not great.

After a few days of renewed interaction, your suspicions are confirmed.

<<include "Ashley - Description">>

::Ashley - Description
Your bratty young sister, $ashley.name has come live with you.

She is entitled and prissy and the two of you haven't gotten along in a very long time. She is hot and knows it. That, with your parents fawning over her when she was little have made her somewhat unsufferable.

She still goes to high school, although she dislikes it.

::Ashley - First Breakfast
$ashley.name comes out of her bedroom looking fresh and ready for school. She plops down at the kitchen table ungracefully and looks at you, arms crossed over her chest.

@@.ashley_talk;"Hey, $protagonist.name! I want breakfast!"@@

<<set $ashley.first_breakfast = "befriend">>\
<<run progressDayPart()>>\
<<set $protagonist.happiness -= 1>>\
You get up and quickly whip up some eggs and pancakes for $ashley.name. She eats with a smile, but never actually thanks you for it.

You hope this initial goodwill gesture will help the two of you bond. After all, you will be sharing a home for the foreseeable future.

Her attitude, though, still sours your mood.

::Ashley - First Breakfast - Antagonize
<<set $ashley.first_breakfast = "antagonize">>\
<<run progressDayPart()>>\
<<set $protagonist.happiness -= 1>>\
You sit down and cross your own arms. The two of you stare at each other for a time, until she finally relents.

@@.ashley_talk;"You are an asshole, $protagonist.name!"@@ She storms out with a huff.

You feel like you did the right thing, putting her in her place.

Her attitude, though, still sours your mood.

<<link "Continue" "New Day Part">><</link>>

::Ashley - First Shower
<<set $ashley.first_shower = "peep">>\
<<run progressDayPart()>>\
<<set $protagonist.happiness += 1>>\
Your sister, $ashley.name finally comes home. She doesn't talk to you, but goes straight to her room.

You are still wondering if you should go talk to her, when you hear her enter the bathroom.

After a couple of minutes, you get up. You can hear the sound of the shower from the bathroom and you see she has left her bedroom door cracked open.

/* TODO: Add option to check on her bedroom. */\
\
You creep up to the bathroom and realize the door is still not locking properly. It has been like that since you moved in.

Carefully you crack the door open and find $ashley.name enjoying the hot water cascading down her lovely naked body. She looks really sexy in there.

You watch for several minutes, unable to tear your eyes away from $ashley.name's nubile curves. The curve of her toned ass, her long legs, her thin waist. She is damn lovely.

Finally, you move away, worried that she may end up seeing you.

::Ashley - First Bullying by Michael
<<set $ashley.bullied_by_michael = 1>>\
$ashley.name comes home in a rush. She is clearly distraught and you think you see smeared makeup before she runs into her room and slams the door closed.

You go to her bathroom and you can hear sobbing.
