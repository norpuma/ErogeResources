##### Narrative:
Allie is a nice girl, polite and considerate to neighbors and family. She is a little cold at school, due to too many girls being envious of her and too many boys being too lascivious when interacting with her. She has a pretty face, generous breasts and nice curves, being conventionally hot. Allie is a blonde who hates blonde jokes. She is not against sex, but she is something of a romantic and would prefer to have sex with someone she really cares about. Allie had a boyfriend in high school and she was best friends with his sister, they moved away at the end of the previous school year and she fels somewhat lonely. Allie dislikes sports and she is very grateful for her genetics. Allie likes reading, movies and she used to love going out for a bite (eating) with her friends before they went away. Allie had another friend, ???, but the two of them had a huge falling out the previous year and they avoid the sight of each other at school. Allie is very proud of her gamer skills. Allie dreams of one day bieng an actress and she likes to memorize lines. Allie is part of the drama club at school. Allie dislikes people who don't take her seriously when she speaks of being an actress (partly because she is very unsure of her chances herself). Allie is not comfortable showing too much of her body, acting provocatively or dressing sluttily. Allie is impatient to finish school to be able to invest in her acting career. Allie frequently goes to the House of Arts. Allie has a very dominant mother, but she loves her anyway. She dislikes people who are not nice to her mother or speak unkindly about her. Allie is curious about her mother's therapy sessions, but she tries to keep her curiosity for herself. Allie has frequent disagreements with her mother, because her mother thinks she is too soft. Allie misses her father and her brother, but her mother has forbidden her to seek them out. Allie only runs in the park or in the neighborhood on weekend mornings because her mother badgers her into doing it. Allie greatly dislikes one of her teachers, ???who and this is one of the main reasons she wants to quit school as soon as possible. Allie used to be something of a tomboy in highschool. She had blossomed yet into her looks and was a goofy girl who liked to make her friends laugh and didn't why she shouldn't participate in any of the boys activities. She was very proud when she first won a videogame match against a boy.
