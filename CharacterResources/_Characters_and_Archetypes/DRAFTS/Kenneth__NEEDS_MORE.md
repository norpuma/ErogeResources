### History:
#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
Kenneth Clarington is a second year student, an inheritor of power and a member of Ashley Collins' crowd. He is more of a follower than a leader, with an entitled attitude and serious confidence issues, he feels the need to be a jerk to feel confident about his status and his value. Kenneth is not confident enough to get girls on his own, not with his attitude, and often relies on Ashley to get him girls. He is often reduced to peeping on girls. He is not much of an athlete and not a good student. Ashley abuses Kenneth, but not too much, as he is useful as a supporter. He would not be popular, in spite of his money, if he didn't hang out with Ashley and her crowd. Kenneth is very attracted to the twins, but they pale besides Ashley, although he doesn't think he will ever be with the latter.
