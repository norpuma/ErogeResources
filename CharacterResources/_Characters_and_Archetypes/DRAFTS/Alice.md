### History:
#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
She blames her brother for her father leaving her mother and, unconciously, she blames her sister for her mother staying so long away from her in the Foundation District. She had to fend for herself in Clarity, becoming hardened, cruel and vain. She was a queen-bee-wanabe at the Finishing School. She had some friends in Finishing School who revealed themselves all to be fair weather friends. She is smart but was never a great student, she dreamed of a career out of her goodlooks or her body, a clothes model or an athlete, she wishes she could teach tennis lessons. She resents her father and has some serious daddy issues, feeling like she had to fend for herself for too long without anyone to protect her. She wishes she could dance better. She wanted to be a cheerleader and was not accepted because she did not dance well enough. She is a little obsessed with sex, but she is weary of it, her mother was very conservative the last few years they lived together and she had a couple of jerk boyfriends, making her weary of jumping into a relationship. She likes to read erotica - a habit she had growing up as her mother liked to see her reading books. She loves going to the dance club, but she feels somewhat self conscious, not having any friends to go with her and not sure her clothes are good enough. She is cruel, she enjoys seeing people she dislikes suffering. She dislikes her brother from the start. She feels like she is entitled to the better things in life and expects people around her to realize that and to fawn over her. She is particularly proud of her looks, but is secretly unsure they will ever be enough. In particular, she is not sure her breasts are big enough, even though she acts as if she thinks they are perfect. She resents her mother a little for staying away for so long, but she starts trying hard to get closer to her mother, helping at home without complaining and watching movies from her mother's selection to be able to talk with her about that. She wants to have friends, but she thinks every guy wants to get into her pants and every girl is deeply and secretly jealous of her looks. She wants to get closer to her sister, but feels a little awkward around her and her patronizing attitude is starting to alienate her "kid sister" - she also dislikes how nosy she has become.
