#### Cannonic (story for this point):
- Bad Investments: Harry pours money into his brother's scheme, without really understanding it. He just knows it is shady and tries not to think too much about it. He will need money to properly setup Sarah's room and may ask his brother for more money. He will need money for a maid to appease Emily and he may ask his brother for more money monthly. Harry has a few stable investments, but they only give him money every twelve months. After a little while, his brother will ask him for more money with the risk of losing everything and having to change his life-style. Harry invests in his brother's enterprise and the brother simply disappears with the money.

He has a reputation as an easy teacher, who never speaks up to students. He is seen as a wimp. Harry is very forgiving of late homework and plans easy tests. Harry is a perv, always ogling cute girls in class and dreaming of them, but never daring making any kind of move on them. Harry has been a teacher for serveral years and used to dream of one day being the principal and having power and respect at school, he only managed to do so recently, when he trasnferred from a different town.
