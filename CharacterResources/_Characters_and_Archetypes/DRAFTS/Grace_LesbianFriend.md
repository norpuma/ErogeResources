  ## Role: F - Lesbian Sweetheart Teen
  ## References: ORIGINAL (from Norpuma's game "Witchcraft at Westwick" - lesbian best friend) also Maid from the game "Summer Job".
  ## Gender: Female.
  ## Status at start of game: Established.
  ## Age: 20
  ## Inspirations: ??? Young woman with a sweetheart appeal lot of lesbian scenes, but some boy-girl scenes (ideally with anal too). Adria Rae, maybe. Or Chloe Foster. Or Chloe Cherry.
  ## Notes: Sub, Tease. She was seriously traumatized by The Event (maybe she saw something) and had terrible nightmares (waking up screaming) and stopped talking. That led to her being held back an year in school when she was much younger. Has a very nice personality, although she can be confrontational when some of her beliefs are challenged. Loves reading sci-fi. Her family is well off, but she takes jobs because her mother wants to keep her "grounded". She has not yet decided what she wants to do in college. Works part time as a maid at Old Master's mansion. Used to work at the Beach Cabanas. Loves the summer for going to the park and the beach. Is a very good friend of School AV Guy. Is a very good friend of Accidental Mage Thief. Has a crush on her old teacher Uptight Science Teacher, but never dared tell her. She is often by herself as her mother is frequently away. She lives in a nice house and it wasn't unusual for the High School parties to be held at her place on the last year of high school. She was at school with School Bully (before he was held back an year), Accidental Magic Stealer, School AV Guy, Overworked Young Master and Cleanup Girl Babe.

You have a friend who is honest and actually loyal to you. She is hot, though, and a lesbian. She has the hots for your girlfriend and if she is offered a chance for power, she will betray you to have the girlfriend.
## Increasing "respect" for lesbian friend.
# At one time you thought you could give Bree some comfort, but you had to be honest with yourself and she needed a friend's comfort from you and some sexual healing from some girl.
# At one time you thought you could have a chance with Bree, but you eventually accepted she was a lesbian, attracted to wother women and that the closeness between the two of you was certainly good enough.
# At one time you thought about just having sex with Bree, but you eventually grew up and decided to respect her as a friend, not just some female fantasy.
# At one time you fantasized about a threesome with Bree and another girl, but you realized thinking like that would just hurt your friendship.
# At one time you thought you would one day have sex with Bree and go beyond friendship, but you realized she was a lesbian and thinking like that would just hurt your friendship.
# At one time you had a crush on Bree, but eventually you accepted she just saw you as a friend and that you should cherish that.
    -> Common Interests -> Friendly Competition -> Greater Intimacy -> Revelation of Homosexuality -> 
        -> Introduced to Troy -> Pissed off at Troy (he implies she needs cock) ->
