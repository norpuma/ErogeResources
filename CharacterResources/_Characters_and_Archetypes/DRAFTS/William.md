William Shine is a nerdy second year student. He is the sole member of the AV Club (audio visual club), loves movies and is a little obsessed with making them. He likes to use drones to capture images. He is something of a peeper, liking to observe things without people noticing. He has been friends with Madison Platter for several years and they started dating a little before school starts on their second year. He has often been the target of the school bully - Chris Dansen. He has an older sister - Nessa Shine - who likes to tease him. It is mostly friendly, but she can sometimes be a little mean. He comes from a low-income family. He is the preferred student of teacher Harry Lawton. He has had a crush on Isabella Perkins for a long time, but realizes she is completely out of his league. He has a little nerd clique of his own with Jeremy Taller, Grace Walton and ???.
