##### Narrative:
Jessica Norris is a cheerleader and one of Ashley Collins sycophants and one of her closest allies. She is a second year student, popular and not very good academically. Ashley keeps her grades and keeps her in the cheerleader squad to keep her influence. Jessica dreams of becoming a dancer and thinks Ashley can help fund her dream. She sees herself as beautiful and isn't against using her sexual appeal to get favors. She may be seen as a slut and has had many hookups (including Kenneth Clarington), but they never last. She is barely aware that she is actually attracted to girls. She is mean spirited, cruel and only respects power. She craves Isabella Perkins' position as head of the cheerleader squad. She has a nerdy brother whom she dislikes, teases and abuses - Edward Surn.

## Role: F - Head Cheerleader Girl
  ## Gender: Female.
  ## Reference: Storyline: ???. Personality: Man of the House's Veronica, Dreams of Desire's Tracy and The Tyrant's Cassandra. Appearance: ??? Jessa Rhodes (porn) - beautiful, with lots of scenes with a cruel face.
  ## Age: 19
  ## Status at start of game: Established.
  ## Enclave Role: Head School Cheerleader.
  ## Personality: Popular, bad student, conformist. Mean. Bitchy. Closet lesbian. "Jerk" personality. Vain.
  ## Notes: Manipulative and with a mean streak, she took the head cheerleader position from Ice Queen Girl (Bella) by blackmailing her (???or exposing her somehow - maybe blackmailed and, then, exposed). Uses her position to abuse more submissive girls. She gets cheerleaders to lick her as a "tease" (a "prank", a "lark", part of "hazing"), but it actually serves to get her lesbian side off (she doesn't dare expose herself). She aims to be the Queen Bee at school and is in a turf war with current queen bee (???who?). She has a timid brother - AV Nerd Boy () - whom she abuses and keeps under control with blackmail. Wishes to own nice things (materialist) and relies on her parents transferring money to her for it, most of the time. Having trouble with school in general and some subject in particular. Wants to be a famous dancer. Encouraged by Principal MILF the previous year - she was told she was entitled to more than what she got; she was told people should be thankful for how hot she looks - the principal was, actually, smitten by her beauty. Her mother disappeared "outside" when she was little. Her father often indulges her and is a historian, teaching at the Foundation District and who, one year ago, got a permit to lead an expedition "outside".
  ## Canon: 
    ### Progress: Abuses her brother - AV Nerd Boy (). Gets a cheerleader to lick her Ice Queen Girl (Bella). Notices AV Nerd Boy () ogling her. Encouraged by the Principal MILF (Catherina) to look for a way to success - starts trying to record dancing videos of herself - pitiful results. Hooks up with a girl (???who?) at the Night Club. Hooks up with a boy (???who?), publicly, as a result of the hooking up at the club. Approached by Athletic School Boy (Lincoln). Gets AV Nerd Boy () to do favors for her - homework, at first. Becomes the female bouncer at the Night Club () bitch - mostly willingly. Makes AV Nerd Boy () her servant. Starts a camshow. Gets gifts from Athletic School Boy (Lincoln) for favors (teasing targets of his) and starts to rely on him. Punished by the Principal MILF (Catherina). Manipulated and whored out by Athletic School Boy (Lincoln). Used to seduce Activist Lesbian Teacher Babe (Alexa).
    ### Femdom Wins: Often tortures AV Nerd Boy () (her first "victim"), but becomes Principal MILF (Catherina)'s bitch as she fucked too many cocks and was too subservient to them. Also Night Club Bouncer () lover and partner, with AV Nerd Boy () as their house pet/servant.
    ### BBC Wins: BBC sub-bitch, often watching Club Bouncer () being fucked and regretting watching it (feeling bad for her former lover) even though they keep AV Nerd Boy () around as their house pet/servant.

  ## Lives at: School Lodgings at first. Moves into the Hotel to share a bedroom with AV Nerd Boy (), her brother.

  ## Relationships:
      ### AV Nerd (): brother. Timid. Victim. Target of some abuse. Perv.
        #### Wishes: Would like him to bother and embarass her less. Would like him to go out less in public and to be more deferential to her without her having to make an effort for it. Dreams of him becoming a slave, doing everything to please her and making her life much easier.
  ## Goals: Become the school's queen bee and prom queen. Become a famous dancer.
  ## Romantic Ideal: Hot and popular athlete asking her for a girlfriend in a very romantic and public setting, helping her social standing.
