### History:
#### Background (story before this point):
##### Narrative:
Carlie Watson is a quiet and timid second year bad student. She is often the target of Jessica Norris pranks and that makes her mad, but she does not dare rise up against Ashley's crowd. She is a nerd and a member of the drama club. She is not confident and, therefore, has not dated, although she has kissed a fellow nerd. She does not conform to school rules, but she is not confident enough to challenge them openly. She is an average student, mostly because she does not channel her energy into that. She is a loner and many see her as aggressive. She does not have friends at school. She is poor and has a part time job to help the family. She is not stupid, but she has too many distractions in her life (job, pranks, etc.) to be a good student.
