##### Narrative:
##### Bulleted:
- Loser voyeur. He is lazy and does not pay proper attention to social norms, sporting an unkempt appearance and becoming very unpopular. He feels a thrill from spying on other people, however and likes to watch in general.
- Technology inclined. He has a knack for electronics, especially surveillance equipment. He is not so good with computers, though. He could learn lockpicking and robotics enough to control a drone.
- Despised by sister and tolerated by mother. His older sister despises him, believing he is a loser and frequently reminding him of that. His mother tolerates him, not wanting to be cruel to him, but having little patience for his shortcomings.
