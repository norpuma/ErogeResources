  # TRAITS:
  ## Traits can be OBSERVED or TESTED for.
  ## Traits can be PHYSICAL, ATTITUDE, STATUS (status or standing) or HISTORIC (the character has done it in the past).
    ### Most Obvious Traits are only obvious once the character is met face to face. Over an Internet chatroom or a phone conversation they may not be.
  ## Traits can be SCALABLE (e.g.: age or height), meaning that one value precludes some others. Scalable Traits are also COMPARABLE (e.g.: "smarter", "taller"). When a Trait is sought or avoided by a character, it may be relative (such as "smarter" or "taller").
  ## Traits can be OBVIOUS, VERIFIABLE (test once and be certain that it exists) and those are either INTRINSIC (once verified, they are unlikely to change) or TRANSITORY (can be tested several times and can change over time).
    ### Characters (usually NPCs) test other characters (usually Protagonists) to find if they have certain Verifiable or Testable Traits.
    ### Some Verifiable Traits may take more than a single test to verify (such as Smart or Adventurous).
    ### A Trait, once observed, verified or tested may change Trust (so that the character will reveal more and become and increase Intimacy), Attraction and/or Respect.
  ## Traits can be BUYABLE, TRAINABLE, CONCEALABLE, FAKEABLE.
  ## Any Trait may be a reason for Pride (positive or negative).
  ## Traits may be governed by attributes (Pride, Fitness, Empathy, etc.).
