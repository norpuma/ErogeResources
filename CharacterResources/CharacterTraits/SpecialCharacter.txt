Sex Drive defines how sexual the character is and at what level Horny usually stabilizes.
    - This can be permanently changed by some factors.
    # -5 to +5. -5 is completely frigid, -3 is frigid, -1 is cool, 0 is unusually stable, +1 is average, +2 is easily excitable, +3 is usually excited, +5 is uncontrollable 
Horny indicates the pressure to find release.
    - Will increase or decrease according to situations throughout the day and decrease or increase by 1 for each "time period" (usually 4 hours) towards Sex Drive.
    - This value can only be temporarily changed.
    - This may make a character distracted. He may lose "Focus" or "Willpower".
    - A character exposed to lots of sexy situations will keep Horny higher than Sex Drive due to circumstances.
    - A character exposed to lots of unsexy situations will keep Horny lower than Sex Drive due to circumstances.
    - For most NPCs, Horny at any given scene will be determined by Sex Drive + random modifier + story modifiers.
    # Horny -2: Disgusted. The thought of sex is disgusting.
        # She is closed and dry. / He is flaccid and shrunk.
    # Horny -1: Cool. The thought of sex seems uninteresting.
        # She is closed. / He is flaccid.

    # Horny 1: Content. They react to excitement with a smile, appreciating it, but not overpowered by it. Still not too excitable at this point, usually. She sometimes gets a distant stare. / He sometimes gets a distant stare.

    # Horny 5: Overexcited/EXTREME. They NEED release. No Focus at all.
        # She masturbates if left alone; also, she finds some arousal with any stimulus to her breasts (or some secondary erogenous area; she may suck on a finger, for instance). / He has serious trouble concentrating and will masturbate at the first occasion. He will grunt at any contact with his erogenous zones, instinctively humping any contact.
    # Horny 6: Craving/UNBEARABLE.
        # She gets wet when giving blowjobs. / Some pre-cum starts leaking. He may have a premature ejaculation.
Sex Urgency is relative to Horny. It 
Excitability is added to any change to Horny
    # -5 to +5. -5 is completely frigid, -3 is frigid, -1 is cool, 0 is unusually stable, +1 is average, +2 is easily excitable, +3 is usually excited, +5 is uncontrollable 
Desire is always directed at a specific character (or a specific stimulus, like a fetish).
    - When a sexual circumstance is implied by the target character, Horny is modified by Desire.
    # Desire -5: Repulsed (cannot tolerate to look at character)
    # Desire -3: Disgusted.
    # Desire -1: Turn off.
    # Desire 0: Indifferent. The same as for a doorknob.

    # Desire 3+: Flushes in the target's presence.
    # Desire 4+: When masturbating, she thinks of target.
    # Desire 5+: She acts on her feelings. Trying to seduce the target. She uses innuendo and tries to seduce.

    # Desire 9+: She begs and humiliates herself for it. She may overcome a taboo.
    # Desire 10+: She begs for anything, any kind of attention is good enough for her (anal, humiliation, etc).

Stimulated indicates how close she is to an orgasm (climax_threshold).
    - When sex starts, Horny is added to this value.
    - The value reached when she *reaches* her orgasm indicates orgasm potency (which may exceed climax_threshold).
    - This assumes a girl starts sex with Horny=3 and gets 3 points of stimulus before climaxing.
    # Stimulated 1+: She is aware of erotic stimulation (physical or mental). / He is aware of erotic stimulation (physical or mental).
    # Stimulated 2+: She feels a little moist. / He is unfolding.

    # Stimulated 5+: Her nether lips are partially open and glistening wet. Her panties get a wet spot. She masturbates if left alone; also, she finds some arousal with any stimulus to her breasts (or some secondary erogenous area; she may suck on a finger, for instance). / He has serious trouble concentrating and will masturbate at the first occasion. He will grunt at any contact with his erogenous zones, instinctively humping any contact.
    # Stimulated 6+: She is wet enough to leak. Any sex act will further stimulate her. She gets wet when giving blowjobs. / Some pre-cum starts leaking. He may have a premature ejaculation.
    # Stimulated 7+: She humps stuff is prevented from masturbating; also, she plays with her asshole when masturbating (or some third erogenous area; she may give herself pain (breast pinching, pussy slapping, etc.), for instance). / He is desperate for stimulus and a climax. He humps the air if prevented from touching himself. Leaks pre-cum continuously. Secondary erogenous zones (like nipples) may cause a climax if over-stimulated.
    # Stimulated 8+: She craves sexual stimulus and will attempt to flee a scene to masturbate - if prevented from doing it, she may admit her craving. / Any sexual stimulus will cause a near immediate climax.
    # Stimulated 9+: She is driven crazy by need and will beg for a chance of release. / He will do anything to get release. He is long past begging.
    # Stimulated 10+: She can cum from almost any kind of stimulus (no need to touch pussy and; anal, humiliating words, breast stimulus, tasting cum...). / Unbearable. A creature of sex. Cannot think or do anything outside seeking release.
Current Climax Threshold indicates the value of "Stimulated" must reach for a character to climax.
    - It assumes they starts having sex at Horny=3 and gets 3 points of stimulus before climaxing.
    - Willpower can temporarily increase this threshold.
    - It can be permanently increased by different factors.


Ideally, men have a high Climax Threshold and a low Refraction period, being able to quickly have an erection again.
Ideally, women have a low Climax Threshold.
Both benefit from high Stamina.
