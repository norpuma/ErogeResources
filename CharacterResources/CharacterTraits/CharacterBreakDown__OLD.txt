# TRAITS:

  ## Traits can be PHYSICAL, PERSONALITY, SOCIAL (status or standing) or HISTORIC (the character has done it in the past).
    ### Most Obvious Traits are only obvious once the character is met face to face. Over an Internet chatroom or a phone conversation they may not be.
  ## Traits can be OBVIOUS, VERIFIABLE (test once and be certain that it exists) and those are either INTRINSIC (once verified, they are unlikely to change) or TRANSITORY (can be tested several times and can change over time).
    ### Characters (usually NPCs) test other characters (usually Protagonists) to find if they have certain Verifiable or Testable Traits.
    ### Some Verifiable Traits may take more than a single test to verify (such as Smart or Adventurous).
    ### A Trait, once observed, verified or tested may change Trust (so that the character will reveal more and become and increase Intimacy), Attraction and/or Respect.
  ## Traits can be TRAINABLE, CONCEALABLE, FAKEABLE.
  ## Traits can be SCALABLE (e.g.: age or height), meaning that one value precludes some others. Scalable Traits are also COMPARABLE (e.g.: "smarter", "taller"). When a Trait is sought or avoided by a character, it may be relative (such as "smarter" or "taller").

Traits:
    > Traits can be Physical, Personality, Social or Historic (the character has done it in the past). Traits can be Obvious, Verifiable (test once and be certain that it exists) and those are either Intrinsic (once verified, they are unlikely to change) or Transitory (can be tested several times and can change over time).
    > Characters (usually NPCs) test other characters (usually Protagonists) to find if they have certain Verifiable or Testable Traits.
    > Most Obvious Traits are only obvious once the character is met face to face. Over an Internet chatroom or a phone conversation they may not be.
    > Some Verifiable Traits may take more than a single test to verify (such as Smart or Adventurous).
    > A Trait, once observed, verified or tested may change Trust (so that the character will reveal more and become and increase Intimacy), Attraction and/or Respect.

# Trust:
    # How much the character believes the other will not betray or hurt them.
    # Also, how much the character believes the other will keep their word. If Trust is high and Afraid is high, only the word is trusted, but not the intentions.
    # Trust usually starts at 1.
    # Trust 0: Doesn't believe anything said, is sure the other has bad intentions towards them and will act on those on the first occasion.
    # Trust 1: Believes the other will behave in socially acceptable ways, at least for as long as there are witnesses nearby and that the other will keep their word if it is not bothersome to do so.

# Horny (depends on sex drives + a random modifier at every scene + story modifiers)
# Stimulated # How close she is to an orgasm (climax_threshold). When sex starts, Horny is added to this. The value reached when she *reaches* her orgasm indicates orgasm potency (which may exceed climax_threshold). This assumes a girl starts sex with Horny=3 and gets 3 points of stimulus before climaxing.
#curr_climax_threshold # This is the value "stimulated" must reach for a character to climax. It assumes they starts having sex at Horny=3 and gets 3 points of stimulus before climaxing. Willpower can temporarily increase this threshold. It can be permanently increased by different factors.

He will grunt at any contact with his erogenous zones, instinctively humping any contact.
            # Horny 6+: She gets wet when giving blowjobs. / Some pre-cum starts leaking.
            # Horny 7+: She humps stuff is prevented from masturbating; also, she plays with her asshole when masturbating (or some third erogenous area; she may give herself pain (breast pinching, pussy slapping, etc.), for instance). / He is desperate for stimulus and a climax. Leaks pre-cum continuously. Secondary erogenous zones may cause a climax if over-stimulated.
            # Horny 8+: She craves sexual stimulus and will attempt to flee a scene to masturbate - if prevented from doing it, she may admit her craving. / Any sexual stimulus will cause a near immediate climax.
            # Horny 9+: She is driven crazy by need and will beg for a chance of release. / He will do anything to get release. He is long past begging.
            # Horny 10+: She can cum from almost any kind of stimulus (no need to touch pussy and; anal, humiliating words, breast stimulus, tasting cum...). / Unbearable. A creature of sex. Cannot think or do anything outside seeking release.

            # Desire -3: Disgusted.
            # Desire -1: Turn off.
