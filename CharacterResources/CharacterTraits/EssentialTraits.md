- Age: This defines the character's opportunities and how others see them. This will usually indicate if they still go to school or if they are expected to have a job.
- Relationships: Most characters will interact depending on the kind of relationship they have. Friendliness, authority, familial and acquaintance are the essential traits that determine a relationship, although they may not be the most determinant for the games' mechanics.
