- The Directorate Center is where the richest and most influential people of the District live. The houses there look like mansions. It is also where the Council meets to take decisions that impact the entire District and even the whole Enclave.
- The Services Center is where people find shops of all kinds and the offices of some of the companies providing services to the district and enclave.
- The Education Center is where people under 21 years old attend the mandatory Finishing Education classes and other people can attend Specialized Education clases - necessary to get a good job in the Enclave. Citizes sometimes have to undertake mandatory Re-Education clases here, too.
- The Lodgings is the largest area of the District. It is where people have their homes - which range from single room affairs to houses with several bedrooms. There are communal showers and baths throughout the area too, as well communal kitchens and the public restaurant.
- The Recreation Center is the area people go to relax and spend some of their income on ephemerals. There is a park in the area, a public pool, a sports arena, a gym center, a couple of bars and a restaurant. There are often people performing music, poetry or even a little acting around here.
- The Enlightenment Center is where the public library is found as well as a temple, an arcane arts division and the House of Arts (museum, art gallery and stage for theater, movies, music and dancing).
- The Control Center is where the surveillance station and security station can be found.
- The Health Center is where the clinics can be found. There is also a veterinarian and a pharmacy.
- The Production Center is the second largest area of the District. It is where manufacturing plants can be found, as well as the farms.
- The Processing Center is near the District Gates. Everyone entering the District must go through the Processing Center. When gengineered were still being produced, they came from the Processing Center too.
- The Digital Center is not actually a physical location, but a virtual place where entertainment can be found. Music, plays and porn can be found online in the Digital Center, as well as some training material for very specific skills.
