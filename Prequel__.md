    In a world overrun by demons and brigands after an apocalyptic collapse of civilization, the Enclave was one of the last bastions of humanity, where the rule of law still applied and humanity commanded. Leonard Norton was not born in the Enclave, but he was one of those few that were authorized to live there, one of the few granted citizenship. Leonard saved a guard's life after the gates were attacked by demons and another guard died. In gratitude for guard Liam Lane's life, the Enclave welcomed Leo among their ranks.

    Leo was aware of you. He didn't know you, but he realized there was a presence that could guide him. Right from the start, he seemed inclined to listen to you.
    
    "Mr Norton, you have been cleared. Our specialists say that you haven't brought anything untoward from Outside. You are citizen of the Enclave, now, and a member of the Enclave's scouting forces. You will need a place to stay, however. For tonight, Cory Lane, guard Lane's wife, would like you to offer you dinner and hospitality. Once again, we are thankful for your service. On a personal note, I want to tell you that Liam is a personal friend of mine and a friend of many of the guards. Your actions won't be forgotten."
    
    Leo got simple directions to the Lane's home and rung their bell. The house was small and simple, but seemed well kept and it's cleanliness was in stark contrast with the grimy neighborhood.
    
    A blonde woman in her early thirties opened the door. She looked at him with mixed emotions, she was trying to smile and there were tears in her eyes at the same time.
    
    "Mr Norton, I presume," she said, trying to contain her emotions.
    
    "You can call me Leo, miss."
    
    "I-" She gave up, then, and stepped closer to Leo to enclose him a sobbing embrace.
    
    Embarrassed, the young man patted her back and tried to comfort her, even though he didn't know what was going on, exactly.
    
    "I am so thankful that you were able to save my husband!"
    
    "It- it was nothing, Mrs Lane."
    
    "No. It was everything! I don't know how Kenzie and I would have survived without Liam's income. It could- it would have shattered us!"
    
    Not knowing what to say, Leo stayed silent and waited for the blonde to regain her composure.
    
    "I'm sorry to break up on you that way, Mr N- Leo," she said, wiping away her tears.
    
    "It's okay, Mrs. I heard... there would be a place for me to stay, here."
    
    "Yes, yes. Certainly!" Cory urged Leo inside.
    
    The house was as small and as clean inside as it looked from the outside.
    
    Cory busied herself trying to make Leo comfortable. She offered him food and introduced him to her daughter - Kenzie. The teenager was small and slim - cute - but she pouted throughout dinner.
    
    When her mother explained to Leo how she would like him to sleep in Kenzie's room, while her daughter would sleep in a cot in the basement, she protested: "Why do we have to take him, mom? He is scum!"
    
    "Kenzie Marie Lane! That is no way to speak to our guest. To a man who saved Li- your father's life!"
    
    After an additional few instants of pouting and crossing her arms, the young woman relented an turned to Leo: "I'm sorry, Mr Norton." And, then, when her mom wasn't looking she stuck out her tongue. What a brat!

    The night was comfortable. More comfortable than a cot in the barracks quarantine area and much more comfortable than a night slept Outside.
    
    Mrs Lane still felt grateful enough that she prepared a generous breakfast the next morning. Kenzie just went by on her way to school and, then, Leo got to talking.
    
    Leo and Cory agreed that Leo could rent the cot in the Lane's house's basement. There was an access door there, so he could come and go as he pleased and he would pay a small fee every week. It was safer than an inn in the foreigners' District and the food was much better, Mrs Lane promised.
    
    Kenzie wasn't too pleased, when she found out in the evening, but her mother made it clear that they needed the money. She agreed, but warned Leo to stay out of her way.

    Leo found out there was a market for items brought from Outside and he made some good money from that. He then set to explore the Enclave a little. The place was organized in districts and crossing between them was more trouble than it was worth. So, he stuck mostly to Temperance, the foreigners' District.
    
    The Strong Water catered mainly to Outsiders and the tables was filled with unsavory types, Outsiders with only a day pass to stay at the Enclave for 24 hours. The booze was good, though, and the bartender was hot. So, Leo decided it would be his watering hole of choice.
    
    "They are putting something in the water, dude," a man told him on his first day there. "They say it's for our health, but I saw how they do it. It uses magic. It's not just some small amount of fluorine or chlorine. They are enchanting us, man!"
    
    In addition to Outsiders, the Strong Water also attracted some blue collar workers from Diligence, the so-called technology District. Bars were forbidden in Diligence, so some of the workers from the facilities had to come to Temperance to drink. The conspiration nut was one of those.
    
    
    
    
    




    "You? Hah! I will never go out with you! You are scum!"
    
    "Music. Old music. But you will never find anything like that out there."
    
    "A guitar? Seriously? I- thank you. I don't know how to play, though."   "I guess you will have to learn..."
    
    "I'm sorry for what I said to you. You- you really helped us, there."
    
    "I- I- I-" she stammers, frightened. "I'm sorry. I won't be like that anymore."
    
    "A spanking, mom? Seriously? I'm 18!"
    
    "No, mom. I- I'm just feeling a little off. Don't worry about it."
    
    "Yes, please. Kiss me!"
    
    "I don't know, Leo. I think we have to take it slow. You know?"
    
    "Hm... yeah... I'm feeling so horny lately. But I don't know."   "That does feel good, keep going."   "Eeek! You- you have a finger in!"   "Ssss! No! Don't stop!"
    
    "You were so good to me. I want to thank you. I want to do something for you. Just- just sit there on the edge of the bed and relax."   "Do you like it? Do you like when I have my mouth on your... thing?"   "I'm glad you liked it! Maybe... maybe next time we can do something more..."
    
    "My dad is home, now. I don't think we can keep doing it..."
    
    "Just- just be quiet, please! Dad can't hear it!"
    
    "Please. I don't want you to be my first!"
    
    "I- I want you to be my first."
    
    "I- I thought we had something special!"
    
    "My... mom? No! You can't ask me to do that!"
    
    




    "Thank you, Leo. I'm glad you decided to stay with us."
    
    "I don't think that would be appropriate, Leonard."
    
    "Oh, from the past? Wine, I guess. What we produce, here, in the Enclave just doesn't taste the same."
    
    "You- you found some? That's amazing, Leo! I wouldn't have dreamed it possible! And you will share it with me? I don't know how to thank you enough!"
    
    "You don't know how grateful I am that you decided to stay with us!"
    
    "No! Please! I'm sorry she wasn't polite to you. I will talk with her. I swear."
    
    "You want me to... spank her?"
    
    "Hm... Leo... stop it! Oh! Yeah! It does feel good. But-"   "Ungh!" She moaned. Then, she turned around, lips pursed for a kiss.
    
    "I- I want you to feel good, Leo. We owe you so much! Just... just relax. Let me do it..."   Her soft, warm hands were a promise of delight.
    
    "There is something I have to tell you. Burt came home. I- I think we will have to keep some more distance, for now."
    
    "Leo! I- I can't leave my husband."   "No! It doesn't matter. I know he doesn't make me as happy, right now. But... we took vows. I just can't."
    
    "Oh, fuck! Yes! You make me feel so good!"
    
    "Just- just once..."
    
    "He- sniff! He was cheating on me! It's over! Burt and I are over!"




    "Listen, if you can get me something fresh. Some nice... I don't know... some pictures or a video, from a girl that is not on the Digital. I might decide to look the other way."
    
    "What more? I don't know. Some kind of stream, perhaps. What about that? A stream where I can see some hot girls doing stuff. In underwear, changing, showering... fucking! Hell, even watching them sleep could be hot."


    "They are putting something in the water, dude. They say it's for our health, but I saw how they do it. It uses magic. It's not just some small amount of fluorine or chlorine. They are enchanting us, man!"


    "They stole my research! I was looking into that compound. I have a theory about alchemy. It has been proscribed, but those people at the Counsel, they are hypocrites! They know how important alchemy is to our enclave. They just don't want to risk the exposition of admitting they are experimenting with it."

    "I have a method of distilling. I just need a lab and some of that blue moss that grows Outside."

    "I thought it would be easy to get a loan to set up my lab. It is harder than I had thought. I will need someone to loan me the money."

    "I can't believe it! Tom actually paid for the lab!"

    "I got an assistant! She is very bright and she is going to help me!"

    "I just- I just want to go back to my wife and kids, you know?"


    "Money to that guy? He is just a sewer rat! He works at the power plant and dreams that he can be some kind of alchemist!"

    "You know what? I looked into that guy's story. He actually was an assistant to Ruskov, that mage that was exiled. He had a teaching position at the East Finishing School. Maybe there is some truth to what he says."

    "I helped him set up his lab. He says it will take a week to prove what he says."
    
    "There used to be a slave brothel here, in the District. Slaves, yeah! Can you believe it? They were Outside girls - and some guys - who Ramon kept as slaves. It was quite profitable. But... sadly Ramon disappeared right after that mage's - Ruskov's - exile."
