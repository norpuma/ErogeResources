You recently got a nervous breakdown at Laketon College. It was not pretty and you can't really remember what happened.

Dr Amanda Hera, your therapist, told you you were under a lot of stress prior to your breakdown and a traumatic event triggered your attack. She counseled you to not try to access your memories right away, but to take it easy at home for some time. She actually advised you not to leave your home as you have become prone to panic attacks when outside of home.

After two weeks, of recovery, you still haven't left the house. Your bills are starting to pile up, though, and you can't go on with your previous life in your current state. You decide to get a roommate and, maybe, some kind of online job.

After interviewing a handful of roommates, you settled on Catherine Quinn. She is a 20 year old young woman studying Psychology who recently transferred to Laketon College in the middle of the semester and is looking for a place to live.

Catherine moved in two days ago and the two of you haven't had much opportunity to talk since then. Maybe you could start tomorrow.

?? Use your computer.
?? Sleep early.
?? Go look for Catherine at night.

---

You wake up early, but Catherine seems to have woken up earlier. You can hear her using the shower.

---

?? Sleep for another half hour.
?? Go check if she isn't actually in her room.
?? Prepare breakfast for the both of you.

---

You go into the kitchen and find Catherine eating cereal out of a bowl.

"Good morning, there!" She smiles at you as you step in.

You have the opportunity to talk to her for a bit.

?? TALK TOPICS

---

You hear something at the door and go check what it is. You call out, but no one answers.

When you open the door, you find a package without a name at the door. The paper wrapping it has the marking of Laketon College and you wander if it is meant for you or for Catherine.

You open the package and find that it contains a tablet computer but without any visible maker's brand. The casing isn't very polished. It looks like a prototype of some kind.

When you turn it on, it displays a welcome screen and, then, there is a single application: "Programming Challenge". You start the app and it shows "Subject 12353: Catherine Quinn" and, then, a series of statistics and a location. You are surprised to find that it seems to be tracking Catherine in real time and it shows a lot of information about her, including medical information, like body temperature and blood sugar levels.

The most surprising, though, is the "Mind Tab". It has some surprisingly personal information about her.

You show Catherine the tablet and she doesn't recognize it. She is not shocked by its existence, though, and thinks its likely to be some kind of prank. She says it may be from her colleagues at the Behavior Psychology Lab as some of the psychological information is pretty accurate and probably come from a form she had to feel when she joined the lab.
