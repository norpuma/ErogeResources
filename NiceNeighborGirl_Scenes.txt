Nikki (starts at Love 1; Submission 0; Libido 1; Liberated 2)

# Nikki (Nicole) Donner
## Role: F - Nice Cheerleader Teen
  ## Gender: Female.
  ## Reference: Storyline: ???. Personality: ???. Appearance: ??? maybe Alex Grey - should look very innocent. Innocent expression but hot body. At least Carolina Sweets. Maybe Emily Willis or Kenzie Reeves. Alex Grey (porn) for her youthful, innocent appearance and anal scenes. Mia Malkova for the flexibility and yoga and youthful appearance.
  ## Age: 18
  ## Status at start of game: Recent arrival.
  ## School Role: Nice Junior Cheerleader.
  ## Personality: Good student, popular, conformist. Nice girl. Sunny disposition. Nice of personality, not naive, but still rather innocent, leading what she wants to be a wholesome life.
  ## Notes: Sub. She is talented and too smart for Head Cheerleader Teen () (or Cruel Cheerleader Teen ()) to try to manipulate her. She is too recent an arrival to be popular immediately, but she soon will become. She likes to play videogames and is good at it. She wishes she was a good dancer and dreams of it. She has simple, innocent, romantic dreams. Her mother was very sexual liberated, which made her a little repressed. She romanticizes sex, including masturbation - and wants to have it only related to love. She also avoid masturbating as she feels it is "wrong" and it makes her embarrassed when she catches herself starting to (which has happened at more than one occasion). Used to date Helpful School Boy, but they never had sex, although they have had some sessions of heavy petting and she has felt the urge to go further with him. She decided to break up because she did not love him. She still cares about him, but does not love him, and he is still in love with her. She is a cheerleader since very recently, her sunny disposition having helped. She does not leverage her position - or her looks - into popularity and power. She was raised, at the Foundation District, by her father, with frequent (weekly) visits from her mother. Always her father's "little princess", she has daddy issues. Got a job as an intern at the Magazine Publisher. Her repressed upbringing makes her ideally suited to become a humiliation slut. Her mother - High Priestess MILF (Isis) - is very domineering, but is very happy to have her back from her father and expects to initiate her into the Temple of Ishtar. Her mother despises men.
  ## Canon: Her mother will start nice to her. Her mother will demonstrate spite and cruelty to any of her male suitors. Spends time with Wallflower Boy (Alec) playing videogames. Manipulated into being punished by Principal MILF (Catherina). Her mother wants her to be strong, manipulative of men and cruel - she will not. Her mother will want her to seduce a strong, useful, manipulatable man - she will not. Briefly dates Wallflower Boy. Bullied and reshaped (with aphrodisiac elixir) by BBC Schoolmaster Boy (Dwayne). Her mother will decide that she does not have what it takes to be a femdom and will accept that she becomes a little sub. Will find out is very turned on by jerks and fuck many of them - initially under some duress (but not outright rape) and, eventually, very enthusiastically, even though she always feels somewhat guilty at taking pleasure with it.
